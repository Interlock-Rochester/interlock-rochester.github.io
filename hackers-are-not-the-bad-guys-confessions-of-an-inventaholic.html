        <p><strong>*Transcription of the&nbsp;talk given at BarCamp Rochester on April 20th,
2013, by Skip Meetze.*</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hello.&nbsp; My name is Skip.&nbsp; I’m an inventaholic.</strong>&nbsp; I am compelled to
invent things for reasons that I can not control.&nbsp; I would like to
welcome you to Inventaholics Anonymous.</p>
<p>Over the past 40 years, I have followed a path familiar to many people
with my affliction by accumulating as many patents as I could. &nbsp;But with
the help of my new friends at INTERLOCK, I have overcome those
tendencies, and I am proud to say that I have moved on to the sober
world of hackers and makers.&nbsp; A world&nbsp; known as the<em>&nbsp;`Open-Source
Hardware
Movement &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_hardware&gt;`__.</em></p>
<p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_1418&quot; align=&quot;alignright&quot;
width=&quot;281&quot;]<a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/04/stepcounter-1.png"><img alt="stepcounter 1" class="wp-image-1418" src="/wp-uploads/2013/04/stepcounter-1.png" style="width: 281px; height: 274px;" /></a> First Patent: The Stepcounter[/caption]</p>
<p><strong>In many ways, being an inventor has scarred my life. &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>In the
early 1970s I squandered all the funds I could beg or borrow (at least I
didn’t steal), and I blew it all on my first patent.&nbsp; The Stepcounter
was a research device to measure the activity levels of laboratory
animals.&nbsp; My wife wanted to make the down payment on a house.&nbsp; Thanks to
my addiction, we rented for 25 years before we bought our first house.</p>
<p>Kenneth Brown, the author of a book called Inventors at Work asked my
old friend, the late Bob&nbsp;Gundlach an important question during an
interview:&nbsp;“Is it better to be an inventor working for a large
corporation, or would you rather be working on your own?”&nbsp; I can relate
to Bob’s answer: “<strong>Being an inventor on your own is a good way to go
broke!</strong> Being an inventor in a corporation is a very fortunate
happenstance.”</p>
<p>But even within a corporation you run into the Not Invented Here
Syndrome.&nbsp; If you offer a solution to improve a product that is outside
of your assigned responsibilities, you will probably&nbsp;be rebuked with
something like “No thanks. I’ve got my own ideas and I know what I’m
doing.&nbsp; Go work on your own assignment.”</p>
<p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_1419&quot; align=&quot;alignright&quot; width=&quot;288&quot;]<a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/04/vue-iPad-in-comfort.jpg"><img alt="vue iPad in comfort" class="wp-image-1419" src="/wp-uploads/2013/04/vue-iPad-in-comfort.jpg" style="width: 288px; height: 170px;" /></a> vue-stand[/caption]</p>
<p>I graduated from Xerox a few years ago and <strong>in 2010, my friend Ken and
I invented a stand for iPads that we called the vue-stand.</strong>&nbsp; It would
hold your iPad at a comfortable eye-level.&nbsp; As a human factors engineer
I have spent decades designing easy-to-use products, and I thought that
we were onto something.&nbsp; After we spent thousands of dollars to do a
pilot run at manufacturing and did a little test market, I couldn’t help
remembering Bob’s words of wisdom.&nbsp; People didn’t buy the vue for
reasons we now understand.&nbsp; We decided not to keep throwing money at
trying to market a dead horse, so I bought out Ken’s interest in our
company, and I continue selling off my inventory&nbsp;online without
promotion.&nbsp; That inventory will cut my losses, but it will not cover my
investment.</p>
<p><strong>Last summer something happened that changed my life:</strong>&nbsp; A couple of
guys from this
<em>`Hackerspace &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace&gt;`__</em> called
INTERLOCK Rochester gave a talk at
<em>`AppleCIDER &lt;http://www.applecider.org/&gt;`__</em>, a local Apple Computer
Users Group.&nbsp; They demonstrated a little desktop 3D printer that they
had built themselves.&nbsp; I was blown away.</p>
<p>I knew about
<em>`Stereolithography &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereo_lithography&gt;`__</em>
and CAD (<em>`Computer-aided
design &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAD&gt;`__</em>).&nbsp; Xerox engineers had
made rapid prototypes using that technology for decades.&nbsp; But specialist
operated those machines, and they had&nbsp;talent and training that I didn’t
have. &nbsp;Furthermore, the machines cost more money than an individual
could afford.</p>
<p>Now, people are building these little machines that can even build parts
to replicate themselves.&nbsp; And people are sharing their designs and
discoveries for other people to build upon.&nbsp; The source code for
anything built on these little industrial robots can be shared online at
a site called Thingiverse.com.</p>
<p>They call the shared technology
<em>`RepRap &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reprap&gt;`__</em> for replicating rapid
prototyping.&nbsp; The designs are evolving unbelievably fast because people
are sharing with each other!&nbsp; What a sobering thought!</p>
<p>I don’t plan to get any more patents.&nbsp; Now I have a reprap machine, and
I have joined the&nbsp;people who share ideas in a Hackerspace.</p>
<p><strong>I used to think of hackers as being the bad guys who stole identities
and maliciously created computer viruses and things like that.</strong>&nbsp; Now it
has come to mean people who take an existing good idea and hack on it to
make it better.</p>
<p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_1420&quot; align=&quot;alignright&quot;
width=&quot;277&quot;]<a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/04/HandleStand.jpg"><img alt="HandleStand" class="wp-image-1420" src="/wp-uploads/2013/04/HandleStand.jpg" style="width: 277px; height: 311px;" /></a> iPad on a HandleStand[/caption]</p>
<p>For instance, I have hacked-up an iPad accessory that I call the
HandleStand.&nbsp; I took a protective&nbsp;iPad case that I bought on Amazon for
$8 and hacked it.&nbsp; I drilled two holes and attached a pair of hinged
handles to it with screws.&nbsp; The case I chose also allows me to attach a
Keyboard that protects the front of my iPad.</p>
<p>The handles open up to make a stand that allows the iPad to tilt at any
angle.&nbsp; Great for making videos or calling people on FaceTime with the
iPad camera that can be pointed in any direction.&nbsp; By the way, it also
holds the iPad at a comfortable eye level just like the vue-stand.&nbsp; But
it is better for all these reasons.</p>
<p><strong>Where can you buy this HandleStand and how much does it cost?</strong>
Sorry, but you can’t buy one.&nbsp; You can get the source code from
<em>`Thingiverse &lt;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:64811&gt;`__</em> however, and
if you can get access to a 3D printer you can make your own!&nbsp; You can
even hack it to make a better one!</p>
<p>You don’t have a 3D printer?&nbsp; Well come on over to INTERLOCK on any
Tuesday or Thursday night and we will help you hack one up.</p>
<p>I must admit that getting these little printers to run is&nbsp;a bit tricky
sometimes.&nbsp; They are complex electronic devices that run on an open
source micro-controller called
<em>`Arduino &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino&gt;`__</em>.&nbsp; The hardware and
software are made from the contributions of many-many people, and
instructions don’t necessarily keep up with the latest developments. A
lot of things can go wrong, and Murphy’s law does apply.</p>
<p>But hackerspaces are springing up all around the world where people help
each other with things like that.&nbsp; So you should join the world of
hardware hackers.&nbsp; Free CAD software has gotten so easy to use now that
even I could learn it.</p>
<p>Pretty soon most people will know how to design using CAD just like now
most people can make Powerpoint presentations.&nbsp; Perhaps it won’t be long
before most people will have access to a 3D printer.&nbsp; I built one from a
kit for a little over $500.&nbsp; Or you can get a MakerBot already assembled
for $2000.</p>
<p><strong>I no longer spend a lot of money trying to sell inventions, I give
them away and save a lot of money.</strong>&nbsp; My designs can no longer be stolen
from me.&nbsp; I’m publishing the source codes on Thingiverse and I am happy
that people are downloading them for free.</p>
<p>People tell me that <strong>I’m missing an opportunity to make money on my
inventions…</strong> I don’t care.&nbsp; I’m an inventaholic.</p>
