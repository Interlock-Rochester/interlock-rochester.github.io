Join us on August 24th for a 6 week class as we join O'Reilly's training
class.<http://training.oreilly.com/arduino/>

For those of you that are new to Arduinos:

> Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on
> flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for
> artists, designers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in creating
> interactive objects or environments. [link](http://www.arduino.cc/)

What you'll learn:

-   Use Processing to create basic software applications
-   Make your own drawing and animation tools
-   Create a GUI (Graphical User Interface) to control your software
-   Use an Arduino to provide physical controls for your drawing and
    animation tools

We'd like to find out how many people are coming so if you're
interested, please sign up on our Meetup.com page:
