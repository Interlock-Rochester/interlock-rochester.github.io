I've been working on a telepresence robot on and off for some time. One
thing I was held up on was getting the main structure built. I had done
a design in Sketch-Up, but had no idea how to actually get it made for
real. It turns out there are several options for getting acrylic designs
produced. In this case, I chose water-jet because it leaves a nice edge
on the finished parts. I wrote up a pretty detailed set of instructions
for building the robot structure on the [project
wiki](https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucabot/wiki/Stand-Assembly). In
those, I talk about the production of the parts and assembly process. It
details how I used Weld-On \#3 to bond the parts. This works very well
for acrylic since it sets up fast, creates a fast bond and is relatively
easy to work with.
