This week was the first time we were able to visit the new home of
Interlock at 1115 E. Main St, Rochester.Â  This is a temporary setup
until the final space across the hall is finished in February but it's
still home.

Thanks to everyone that was able to come and those of us that were able
to bring stuff to make it less empty.
