We're pleased to announce that we will be welcoming Girl Develop It
(GDI) on Nov 12th and 13th from 6:30-8:30pm for a two day HTML and CSS
training class. After meeting with organizers Kristen Curtze and Liz
Gombert, we thought this was something Interlock Rochester should and
could support.

About Girl Develop It
---------------------

Girl Develop It is a nonprofit organization that was launched in New
York in 2010. The initial goal was to draw more women to the development
community and to provide judgment-free learning opportunities through
teaching one another. Girl Develop It has since grown within the vision
of creating a network of empowered women who feel confident in their
abilities to code and build beautiful web and mobile applications. The
organization is currently making an impact in 33 cities around the US
and Canada with 10 new chapters, including Rochester.
