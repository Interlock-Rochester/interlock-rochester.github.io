[Congresswoman Louis Slaughter](http://www.louise.house.gov/) visit to
Interlock centered around the idea that a small group of people can make
an impact and rediscover the future. I may be embellishing a little but
I do think there was a sense that even if we did not always agree that
the conversation is always worth having. The 3D printers were a big hit
as they usually are and Skip was on hand to demonstrate a few of his
“little” projects.

Here Skip shows how the 3D printed prosthetic hand works to the
Congressman. The hands are being made for e-NABLE an organization
networking volunteers using 3D printers to make and give hands to
children[.](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/34056332/Alex.jpg)
