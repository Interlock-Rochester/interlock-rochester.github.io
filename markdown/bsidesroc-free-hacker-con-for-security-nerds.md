What to expect
--------------

If you've never been to a hacker con, it's a bit different than your
standard conference. Don't expect the venue to be a hotel. In fact,
it'll be at an old Masonic Temple inside the Auditorium Center.

There will be a lock picking village where the local [Rochester TOOOL
chapter](http://interlockroc.org/2012/04/19/new-lockpicking-club-rochester-toool/)
will be around to teach people how to pick locks and the issues involved
with physical security. They'll also be selling lock picks to attendees.

Other stuff for those interested:

-   a dozen or so presentations about information security by industry
    professionals
-   a capture the flag hacker games competition
-   a hacker puzzle to figure out during the con
-   free breakfast and lunch
