This Tuesday at 7pm, we'll be welcoming Rob Bishop of the Raspberry Pi
Foundation to do a workshop. He'll be bringing in a bunch of Raspberry
Pi's to play with and hack on during the event. The workshop is, as
always, open to the public so we welcome anyone that's interested in
attending. This would be a good time to either start learning about
Raspberry Pi's or take your project to the next level.
