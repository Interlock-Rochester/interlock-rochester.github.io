On Tuesday December 8th, we are inviting everyone to our next
installment of the "How Do I Seminar Series." This time, we will have
Ryan Tucker talking about software-defined radios. SDRs are becoming
cheaper and easier to use and it allows anyone interested to play with
RF project. Here are a few examples:

-   Capture communications from things that are broadcasting like planes
    and trains
-   Learn how RF remote controls work
-   Listen in on communications to see if they are transmitting
    sensitive information

Want to attend? Here's what you might want to bring:

-   OPTIONAL: Laptop for taking notes or playing with the tools
-   OPTIONAL: RTL-SDR if you already own one

If you are attending, please RSVP so that we know how many people to
