On Tuesday Rob from [Machinist
Blog](http://www.machinistblog.com/first-attempt-at-making-machineable-wax/)
stopped in to make machinable wax.

We are making Machinable wax is a material that is used on traditional
metalworking machines (Mills, lathes, etc), it is used to test a new
technique or for teaching.  The shavings are not sharp, and the
end-product can be melted and reused.  When made by us, it is
significantly less expensive then buying metals.

This will be great for practicing with our Sherline Mill, or Craftsman
12" lathe.

Thanks Rob!
