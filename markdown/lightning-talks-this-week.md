This Tuesday at 7pm will be our second Interlock Lightning talks. If you
didn't hear about our last one, it was a ton of fun and a lot of people
came out.

Here's more info on what a Lightning Talk is:
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Talk>

If you've never heard of the idea, it's easy. You make a presentation
but it's only 5 minutes long. We'd like to have everyone involved. The
more presentations we have the better. The only rules is, you have 5
minutes and you will be timed!

If you're not a member, we want you to come and you can even do a talk
or just sit back and be entertained.Â  Anyone that would like to be added
to the list can email antitree at interlock roc dot org.
