Since clocks are a "thing" now, and people are thinking about building
them, the space will be open this Saturday from noon to 4PM. If anyone
wants to come and build their clock or teach someone else how to do it,
come on by. We have a few Ardiunos for sale and many random electrical
bits around but you will need some parts and plans.
