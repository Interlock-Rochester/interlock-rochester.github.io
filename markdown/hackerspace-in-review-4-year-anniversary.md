This last Saturday, we had a members (and friends of members) only
annual meeting. Normally this is a time for everyone to hang out, eat,
drink, and give presentations. Previous years, I give my personal
presentation about things I wanted to do, things I failed at, things I
succeeded, and things I'll be attempting the coming year. We invited
everyone this year to give a similar style presentation and the results
were pretty interesting.

Our Past
--------

A quick review of where we're at. The organization started in
September-ish of 2009, where we met in coffee shops around Rochester, to
try and come up with whether or not we should make a hackerspace in the
area. We came to the conclusion that we wanted to do everything from the
ground up, receiving no outside financial help. At the time, we were
pretty adamant about not having it called a "Makerspace" because the
membership had a much wider range of interests than just making
(software development, hardware reverse engineering, network security,
radio, art, etc). So our bylaws stated that we will create a space
focused on the interests of the members at that time. This gave us a lot
of flexibility to interpret what the space would be used for. We
received our [New York State articles of
Incorporation](http://appext20.dos.ny.gov/corp_public/CORPSEARCH.ENTITY_INFORMATION?p_nameid=3901177&p_corpid=3894341&p_entity_name=Interlock%20Rochester&p_name_type=A&p_search_type=BEGINS&p_srch_results_page=0)Â just
about January 1st of 2010. From there we have expanded spaces starting
out at a meager 200 sq ft temporary space, moving to a 500 sq ft space,
and eventually to our current home which is over 1200 sq ft. Our
[mission
statement](http://wiki.interlockroc.org/wiki/index.php/Mission_Statement)
has been the same since its inception, to provide a space to its members
and the community, as well as be an organization that helps individuals
developer their skills in science, art, and technology.

Our Present
-----------

As always, we had a wide range of accomplishments from our members. Here
are a list of things have been working on recently:

-   Reverse engineering Ms. Pac-Man
-   Using thermite and tannerite in fun ways
-   Take EdX, Coursera, classes together: Cryptography, in-line power
    supplies, calculus, basic electronics
-   Creating a high power antennae with low amounts of money
-   Security research using open source intelligence
-   Using a Raspberry Pi and home sensors to graph and monitor
    temperature changes in your fridge
-   Artistically building a gigantic light bulb array (without burning
    down your apartment)
-   Converting your Perl scripts over to BASH (as an excuse to hang out
    with your kid)
-   Skip's Adventures in 3D printing

This might give you an idea of the completely different background that
our members have, but with the common denominator of expanding and
learning more than they do right now.
