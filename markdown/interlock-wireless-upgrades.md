Often as time goes the team that runs Interlock IT infrastructure needs
to make updates and upgrades to our systems.   This has happened
recently with the upgraded wireless infrastructure right here at
Interlock.  While this was done about a month back, full production cut
over happened earlier this week.  We were using a Meraki (Cisco) based
wireless system.  While nice, it had an annual renewal cost that was
unfortunately not sustainable for us.  After much research and
thoughtful debate, the decision was to use a Ubiquiti based wireless
system. Here are some action shots of the team installing them.

Wonderfully professional install if you ask me.  Here is a nice image of
the layout.

As you can see we have upgraded to having a 5 Ghz AP as well.  If you
want to use it please be aware that we have some new SSIDs created.
