Finally a project I finished. I made a [Pirate
Box](http://piratebox.cc). Pirate Box is a Wi-Fi device that people can
connect to and share files anonymously because it isn't connected to the
Internet.

Started with a [Raspberry Pi
B+](http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-b-plus/), [Eleduino
case](http://www.eleduino.com/products_ny_166.html), [8 GB microSD
card](https://www.pny.com/high-performance-microSD?sku=P-SDU8G10-GE),
[32 GB memory
stick](https://www.pny.com/Compact_Attache?sku=P-FD32GCOMB-GE) and a
[TP-Link TL-WN722N USB Wireless
Adapter](http://www.tp-link.us/products/details/?categoryid=3958&model=TL-WN722N).

This is what it looks like completed.

When you connect with Wi-FI to "Pirate Box - Share Freely" it will show
the following screen with a chat program and flie upload. (Looking to
change the SSID in the future.)

This is the message board.

And the files that are uploaded to be shared.

This would be prefect to use to exchange encryption keys at BSidesRoc or
have the presenters post their papers to share with the public.
