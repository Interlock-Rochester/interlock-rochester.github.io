Next Thursday, July 15th, we will be making amateur radio 2M antennas
(half-wave, j-pole). If anyone is interested in learning about antenna
theory, soldering, or anything else that goes into making antennas...
come down and check it out.

**UPDATE:** Due to a mixup with our supplier we won't have the materials
to make\
antennas until NEXT Thursday, July 15th. We will hold antenna make\
night then.
