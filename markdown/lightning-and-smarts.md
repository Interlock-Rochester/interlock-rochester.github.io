Last night more than two dozen people joined us for our second edition
of Lightning Talks. A time for people to share their interests or a
random subject they've just learned. The talks showed the range of
knowledge of Interlock from artificial intellegence, soldering, art
history, orienteering, making booklets, cross site scripting attacks,
the board game go, IRSSI, cat5 cables, learning how to program, things
going on at RIT, guest wireless access points, offsite backup solutions,
and 3D molecule rendering.
