Last night marked the Rochester Hackerspace's first [lightning
talk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Talk) event where we
invited members and friends to come and present on a subject of their
choosing that is less than 5 minutes long.  The subjects reflected the
diverse backgrounds of its members; making pcb boards, bump keys, book
binding, boxes, wii bluetooth, and machine guns! We had almost 30 people
crammed into our temporary hackerspace sitting on anything we could
find.  Thanks to everyone that made it out and especially those that
took the time to put a talk together.

UPDATE: [RemyD](http://decausemaker.org/) was cool enough to offer his
point of view on a first experience visit to Rochester's Hackerspace and
interview a few of us to help spread the word.  Check out [RIT's
