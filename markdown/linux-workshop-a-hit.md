Yesterday we held our first Linux Workshop from noon to 4pm, and were
able to help several people troubleshoot and configure their computers.
 We were lucky to have several members of the [Linux User Group of
Rochester (LUGOR)](http://www.lugor.org/) and [Ubuntu
Loco](https://wiki.ubuntu.com%C2%A0%3Ca%20href=) meeting on Thursday,
Feb 4, 7-9PM at Barnes and Noble @ RIT where Charles Profitt will be
giving a presentation on data recovery.

If you're either having problems with Linux and could use some personal
help, would like to help others, or want to just hang out, swing by
Interlock February 6th noon to 4!
