This Friday, November 5th, [Rochester
2600](http://www.rochester2600.com/) will once again occupy the halls of
Interlock for its monthly meeting. The topic du jour will be lock
picking, with an introductory presentation from
[AntiTree](http://twitter.com/antitree). There will be pick sets and
several types of locks on hand, so come learn a few new tricks and enjoy
some grub from [Cam's
Pizzeria](http://www.camspizzeria.com/locations/eastave.html). The
festivities start at 7:30PM.
