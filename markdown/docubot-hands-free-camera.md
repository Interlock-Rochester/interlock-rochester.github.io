Surely this will be my last poorly documented project: a hands-free foot
operated documentation camera. I thought it'd be handy, and I had an old
broken desk lamp kicking around, so of course, the two must be mushed
together.

I started out with an old Canon SD1000, with
[CHDK](http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/CHDK) installed of course. For those
in the dark, CHDK is an alternate firmware that works on lots of point
and shoot cameras (not just Canon, anymore), and it lets you run
scripts, save pictures as raw files, and tweak every setting you could
ever possibly want to. It's awesome, and I needed it so I could trigger
the shutter via an external button (you basically toggle +5v on one of
the USB port pins).

I didn't want to worry about running out of batteries mid-shoot, so I
printed a dummy battery at [Shapeways](http://www.shapeways.com/), ran
some wires through it, then tinned and bent over the ends of them to
make some pseudo "terminals". These went out a hole I drilled in the
battery door, through the lamp, to a simple 5v voltage regulator, wired
up straight out of the
[datasheet](http://www.national.com/ds/LM/LM109.pdf). This 5v source
also goes through an old lamp foot switch to the camera's USB port, for
the external trigger.

Finally, I took to the lathe to make an adapter between the weird lamp
thread and standard camera tripod thread (1/4" diameter, 20 threads per
inch). I used a bit of round delrin stock, bored out the appropriate
diameters, and just cranked a bolt through rather than threading things
properly.

I tried a few test shots last night, while I put together [Mighty Ohm's
Geiger Counter Kit](http://mightyohm.com/blog/products/geiger-counter/).
It works pretty well, but can't really zoom in close enough to document
very fine work. Hopefully it will still be useful for documenting other
tasks that require both your hands in frame. Failing that, I'm sure
there will be other uses for a scriptable camera attached to a
flexible-yet-solid base... perhaps it will turn into a time-lapse-bot.
