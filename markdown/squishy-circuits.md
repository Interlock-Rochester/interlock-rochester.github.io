This was a project I saw on the web called [Squishy
Circuits](http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/apthomas/SquishyCircuits/). The
idea is to make a dough like substance that will conduct electricity.
Then you can mold it into interesting shapes and incorporate electrical
components into the sculpture without putting wires inside. Connecting
things does not require using a soldering iron - you just stick a wire
into the dough.

So the first step is to prepare the dough.

We are making two kinds of dough here - conductive and non-conductive.
The conductive dough will be used for making wires and the
non-conductive dough will separate the conductive pieces so we don't
have a short circuit. The conductive dough is colored with red food
coloring and the non-conductive is left uncolored.

The conductive dough:

Next we mix up the non-conductive dough.

Now that we have the dough it is time to experiment. First check to see
if the conductive dough really is.

resistance?"][![image9](http://interlockroc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/DSC_0163-150x150.jpg)](http://interlockroc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/DSC_0163.jpg)[/caption]

The resistance was over 40K ohms which seems very high but lets see how
it works. I used 4 AA batteries for power and two LEDs. The pink dough
on one side is ground and the other is +6 volts.

And it works! Yeah. The LEDs are pretty dim but the are glowing. Trying
different sizes and shapes of dough and some different LEDs we did
manage to get a little better results.

After seeing our results our taste tester wanted to try something a
little different - he built a battery out of the dough. To make a
battery you several segments or "cells" hooked together in series using
two different metals. Here it was steel staples and copper wires. And
here it is.

So 6 cells make a 1V battery.

The next experiment will be to try a week later to see if the dough is
still conductive. Also, it will be interesting to see if the
conductivity wears out as it is used. And what happens if we let it dry
out?

Experiments for another day.

Thanks to Jaimee and Bill for their help with this.
