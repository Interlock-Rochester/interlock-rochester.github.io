Given our number of active ("radioactive"?) amateur radio enthusiasts,
we recently applied for a club station license to give Interlock its
very own call sign. The paperwork arrived last night and we're pleased
to announce that Interlock now has an official presence on the air. The
aptly named call sign, K2HAX, has also been applied for.

We are currently VHF/UHF capable using a homemade J-Pole antenna. Our
roof antenna project is progressing nicely and, despite a few snags, the
necessary supplies will soon be ordered in hopes of being functional
before the city experiences any significant snowfall. When all is said
and done, we will have a fairly powerful ham station capable of reaching
the far edges of Monroe County and beyond.

Upcoming projects include using modified Motorola Bravo pagers for
paging over ham frequencies, and setting up a WinLink node to allow for
e-mailing over ham radio.
