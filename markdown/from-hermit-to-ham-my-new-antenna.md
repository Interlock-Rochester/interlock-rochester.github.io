graduating RIT this May with a BS in Information Technology, I moved out
to rural Livingston County; some 30+ miles away from Interlock and
downtown Rochester. Partially because of the distance to the local
repeaters, and partially to impress the ladies, I picked up an [Arrow
Antenna](http://www.arrowantennas.com/) dual-band (VHF/UHF) j-pole style
antenna from our friend Steve KC2YTC along with a used 30' antenna
mast. Installation entailed mounting the mast to the side of my house,
installing the antenna, soldering the PL-259 connector to a coax cable
(LMR-400 from hamfest) and running it down to my Yaesu FT-8800 that sits
in my office. This ended up being a great little antenna and now I'm
back talking with my friends on the Rochester repeaters. Special thanks
to Chris N2CDO for help soldering the PL-259 connectors on the coax.

N0BDW is back on the air!

For all you Hams out there, check in to the Monroe County ARES/RACES
net on 146.61 / 444.45 (N2MPE) repeater on Thursday nights at 9pm EST
and you'll likely hear me there.

I'm also volunteering with Livonia Fire/EMS, so for the public safety
scanning enthusiasts listen for 298[X] (EMS) or 25[X] (fire) on
Livingston County Fire/EMS dispatch (46.16).
