will be an introduction to encryption. This will be a hands on,
practical learning about the basics of things like symmetric vs
asymmetric ciphers, hashing vs key derivation functions, the good and
bad of normal algorithms, and maybe some demos using existing libraries
like NaCL. As always, this is open to the public and all are welcome.
You can &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.meetup.com/Interlock-Rochester-Hackerspace/events/230838766/"&gt;RSVP

generating GPG keys and what to do with them when preparing to go to a
key signing event. Then at BSides Rochester on April 23 there was such
an event. Following the key signing event at BSides there was a repeat
of the class on generating your GPG keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for a follow up to the follow up, Interlock is hosting a Crypto
Party on Friday, May 5 at 7PM as a prelude to the regular 2600 meeting.
So come out on Friday to get your keys signed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you missed both classes but are still interested in having a secret
decoder ring of your very own the slides are now available

our first How Do I (HDI) related to security -- Burp Suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burp Suite is an HTTP/HTTPS proxy tool that can help you better
understand how a web application works. Designed for security, it
allows anyone to man-in-the-middle(MITM) web traffic, learn how a
web application works, and manipulate the traffic to see how the
application responds. Uses include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- debugging your web application to find why it doesn't work&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- identifying and exploiting security vulnerabilities&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- using it to inspect mobile traffic&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- answering the question ... &amp;quot;I wonder how that works&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seminar will start with a basic presentation about the Burp
Suite tools which is provided free to download.[0] The class will
walk through identifying vulnerabilities in a demo web site. All
attendees are expected to bring a laptop (Linux, OSX, or Windows) or
coordinate borrowing one before the workshop. If you have the ram to
support it, it's also recommended you run Vmware Player /
Workstation / Fusion on your system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're interested, please RSVP on the meetup site below. As always,
the workshop is open to the public for free. Please consider dropping a
few dollars in the donation bucket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.meetup.com/Interlock-Rochester-Hackerspace/events/225750884/"&gt;RSVP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
