Interlock has entertained guests from&amp;nbsp;all over. Sometimes travelers will
email us saying they are doing a tour of hackerspaces in the region and
wanted to stop in for a night. When we're available, we're happy to
entertain at the space and even take them out for a drink.&amp;nbsp;I remember
one&amp;nbsp;visit from a group travelling first&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;New York City (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.nycresistor.com/"&gt;NYC
Resistor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.alphaonelabs.com/"&gt;Alpha One
Labs&lt;/a&gt;), going up through Syracuse (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sig315.org/"&gt;SIG
315&lt;/a&gt;), to Rochester (&lt;a class="reference external" href="#"&gt;Interlock&lt;/a&gt;) and
ending up in Toronto (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://hacklab.to/"&gt;Hacklab&lt;/a&gt;). Our members
have visited spaces all over the country; Florida, Texas, California,
North Carolina, and Washington DC are a few that I can remember. There
is even a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/passport"&gt;hackerspace
passport&lt;/a&gt; that Noisebridge
started where you can get it stamped at the various hackerspaces that
you visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="hakkavelin20141230-205213"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hakkavélin&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2015/01/20141230_205213.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="20141230_205213" class="size-medium wp-image-1890 alignright" src="/wp-uploads/2015/01/20141230_205213-168x300.jpg" style="width: 168px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myself and another member recently visited Iceland for New Years for
just over a week and the day after we landed, we jumped on the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hakkavelin.is/"&gt;Hakkavélin&lt;/a&gt; IRC channel to reach out to see
when open hours were and if we could arrange a visit.&amp;nbsp;While the space
wasn't opened due to the holidays,&amp;nbsp;Sigurður óskarsson&amp;nbsp;was kind enough to
meet us at the hackerspace to take us out to a cafe in town.&amp;nbsp;We talked
shop&amp;nbsp;a bit, discussing projects people were working on and history of
each others' spaces, along with operational details like how they
handled membership and how much they charged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned about their &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hakkavelin.is/post/74269934436/the-evolutionary-stages-of-the-door-bot"&gt;door
system&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;which
consisted of a full computer sitting outside of the space controlling
the door lock. In order to get in, you have to figure out how to use the
console in a hackery way. As I understand it, there's also an IRC bot
which controls this door if you message the right user. Located inside
the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=16/64.1243/-21.9251"&gt;University of
Reykjavik&lt;/a&gt;,
the group&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;just outside of the downtown area in South Reykjavik. With
only four hours of light this time of year, I wasn't able to get a good
look at the university but the buildings I saw were pretty with huge
glass walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have never considered looking up a local hackerspace on your
vacation or business trip, I would strongly recommend you consider it
next time. It's a great way to meet like-minded folk in different
locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

annual meeting. Normally this is a time for everyone to hang out, eat,
drink, and give presentations. Previous years, I give my personal
presentation about things I wanted to do, things I failed at, things I
succeeded, and things I'll be attempting the coming year. We invited
everyone this year to give a similar style presentation and the results
were pretty interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="our-past"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Past&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick review of where we're at. The organization started in
September-ish of 2009, where we met in coffee shops around Rochester, to
try and come up with whether or not we should make a hackerspace in the
area. We came to the conclusion that we wanted to do everything from the
ground up, receiving no outside financial help. At the time, we were
pretty adamant about not having it called a &amp;quot;Makerspace&amp;quot; because the
membership had a much wider range of interests than just making
(software development, hardware reverse engineering, network security,
radio, art, etc). So our bylaws stated that we will create a space
focused on the interests of the members at that time. This gave us a lot
of flexibility to interpret what the space would be used for. We
received our &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://appext20.dos.ny.gov/corp_public/CORPSEARCH.ENTITY_INFORMATION?p_nameid=3901177&amp;amp;p_corpid=3894341&amp;amp;p_entity_name=Interlock%20Rochester&amp;amp;p_name_type=A&amp;amp;p_search_type=BEGINS&amp;amp;p_srch_results_page=0"&gt;New York State articles of
Incorporation&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;just
about January 1st of 2010. From there we have expanded spaces starting
out at a meager 200 sq ft temporary space, moving to a 500 sq ft space,
and eventually to our current home which is over 1200 sq ft. Our
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.interlockroc.org/wiki/index.php/Mission_Statement"&gt;mission
statement&lt;/a&gt;
has been the same since its inception, to provide a space to its members
and the community, as well as be an organization that helps individuals
developer their skills in science, art, and technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="our-present"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Present&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, we had a wide range of accomplishments from our members. Here
are a list of things have been working on recently:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reverse engineering Ms. Pac-Man&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using thermite and tannerite in fun ways&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take EdX, Coursera, classes together: Cryptography, in-line power
supplies, calculus, basic electronics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a high power antennae with low amounts of money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security research using open source intelligence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a Raspberry Pi and home sensors to graph and monitor
temperature changes in your fridge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Artistically building a gigantic light bulb array (without burning
down your apartment)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Converting your Perl scripts over to BASH (as an excuse to hang out
with your kid)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skip's Adventures in 3D printing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might give you an idea of the completely different background that
our members have, but with the common denominator of expanding and
learning more than they do right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian, also decided to do a 3D sculpture of the Walter and Cheryl so he
took a bunch of pictures as they held hands. With the help of some
software, he'll be able to turn them into a 3D model and hopefully print
them out so they look like cake toppers. Congratulations guys!&lt;/p&gt;

questions about Interlock. Von, showed off the ham radio room and his
skills for speaking with human beings. Bill spoke about his background,
why he has been involved with Interlock, and included some razzle dazzle
by printing on the 3D printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian, with his boyish good looks, sparkled on camera while showing off
his knowledge of all things blinky. I have to admit that while it's nice
to have Interlock get some PR, my first goal in setting up the interview
was to get Brian's face on TV. If you've met Brian, you'll know that
he's a very intelligent, multi-faceted, multi-facial-haired, reluctant
leader. I think that he is a very good representation of what the modern
hacker/maker looks and acts like. But, he's also not the normal talking
head you would see on TV which is why I want to get him out there even
more. I'm giggling right now thinking about seeing him on YNN now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling bad for the quiet bear-hat wearing man on the couch, YNN even
included me in a quick interview. I worked with Bill and Von on a lock
picking demo that I hope makes to air. Veronica even challenged me to a
lock picking contest where I had to go from nothing in my hands, pick up
the tools, and pick the lock. I surprisingly aced it picking a 4 pin
lock. (Thanks &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.toool.us"&gt;TOOOL&lt;/a&gt;) This will never be on the
air of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Von Brian and Bill for taking the time to come out and
intelligently represent the group. We don't know when/if the story will

&lt;p&gt;As is usually the case, Interlock managed to cajole/bribe the organizers
of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://barcamproc.org/"&gt;BarCamp Rochester&lt;/a&gt; into giving us a table
in the atrium, upon which we could set up our wares and lure in
unsuspecting geeks. The conference itself was really great, with lots of
interesting talks, and lots of attendees and traffic by our table.
Everybody seemed quite excited about the &amp;quot;Skeletonizing Carcasses with
Flesh-eating Beetles&amp;quot; talk, myself included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, we've had a slight lack of table-sized projects that moved,
made noise, or otherwise stimulated people to come talk to us and see
what Interlock is all about... but no longer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2011/10/DSC_84971.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-666" src="/wp-uploads/2011/10/DSC_84971-1024x678.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After becoming a little obsessed with &lt;a class="reference external" href="/plottopotamus.html"&gt;old pen
plotters&lt;/a&gt; over the
past few months, I decided I'd like to try assembling my own drawing
robot. The main goal, again, was to have something small, cool, and
interactive to attract folks at events where we have a table or booth.
So about a month ago, our journey started with destruction... one
printer and one printer/scanner gave their slightly non-functional lives
to this project. Anything slightly cool was saved, and of course the
precision rods, stepper motors, and timing belts were the main goal. I
wanted this to use pin-feed card stock, so an old dot-matrix printer was
also sacrificed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was without camera for most of the month, so documentation is
non-existent. Regardless, the documentation would have been something
like this: &amp;quot;!&amp;#64;#$!&amp;#64;#$ MORE EPOXY! !&amp;#64;#%!#$&amp;quot;, along with pictures of me
looking frustrated. Let's just say, this machine is a hack, on top of a
kludge, wrapped in a cob-job. We ended up with the paper-feed mechanism
from the dot-matrix printer acting as the Y axis, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/412"&gt;a small solenoid
from adafruit&lt;/a&gt; riding along on
the X axis with a wobbly pen-holder (and some tape (and epoxy!)). This
was all hooked up to a rickety breadboard (I designed and ordered an
Arduino shield via &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://batchpcb.com"&gt;Batch PCB&lt;/a&gt;, but it didn't
arrive in time) with two &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/1201"&gt;Polulu stepper
drivers&lt;/a&gt;, an Arduino, and
a simple transistor doohicky for toggling the solenoid. We ran
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/simen/grbl"&gt;grbl&lt;/a&gt; on the Arduino, and after
tracking down a bug in said code and reflashing the firmware, we were
well on our way. I learned a lot, stressed a bit, and the morning of
BarCamp we barely managed this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2011/10/DSC_8494.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-672" src="/wp-uploads/2011/10/DSC_8494-1024x678.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it got better throughout the day, with some live on-the-scene
hacking. I managed to get a toolchain set up to get webcam input traced
and plotted thusly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/6294760604/"&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG_8267" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6039/6294760604_cbcfdc264e_z.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That toolchain starts with
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/"&gt;OpenCV&lt;/a&gt; handling the webcam,
and doing a &amp;quot;trace outlines&amp;quot; sort of procedure. From there, a PNG is
saved, converted to vectors by
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://autotrace.sourceforge.net/"&gt;autotrace&lt;/a&gt;, converted from eps to
hpgl (the language of old-timey plotters) by
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.pstoedit.net/"&gt;pstoedit&lt;/a&gt;, slurped back into Python via
the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://music.columbia.edu/cmc/chiplotle/"&gt;Chiplotle HPGL
library&lt;/a&gt;, where I have a
few routines scale and optimize the tool path, and then we output some
ugly gcode and stream it to the Arduino. Phew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a bit roundabout. But it worked, and it made people smile and
wander over to talk to us... and they got some cool robo-portraits out
of it. I'll leave you with another image and video of the bot doing its
thing. A few more can be found in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/sets/72157628015314436/detail/"&gt;my flickr

in the infosec hacker realm. I go to hacker cons like Defcon but Maker
Faire was a new intense gathering of super positive people. Where else
can you say you saw a giant hydrolic fire breathing dragon next to a one
man drum corp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really the only reason I went down was to volunteer at the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.toool.us"&gt;TOOOL&lt;/a&gt; booth with a couple of friends. I spent
the weekend teaching kids and adults how to pick locks. I'll just say
that I don't hang around kids very much but teaching an 8 year old how
to pick locks was pretty freaking cool. But the highlight of my weekend
was teaching an NYPD officer how to pick a master lock.&lt;/p&gt;

mill&lt;/a&gt; we're building.
Although the parts are designed to be easily cut by hand, I really
wanted an excuse to see some big-ass lasers and to make the acquaintance
of those in charge of said equipment. So off we went. Keep scrolling for
pictures and some commentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/5334426416/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Interlock tours Smidgens 1" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5049/5334426416_11c9b20eb5.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 333px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gary – the co-owner of Smidgens, along with his wife Rita – gave us
quite an extensive tour, and answered all of our pesky questions while
we gawked at the machinery. Above, you can see one of their lasers
cutting crane parts out of quarter-inch steel. I was pretty surprised
how quiet the whole operation was, given the amount of cutting going on.
Most of the noise was from the ventilation systems that were constantly
huffing smoke out to the great outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/5333845225/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Overall Shop" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5044/5333845225_5646c6a98a.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 333px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the butt-shot, but here's an overall view of the main space.
There's one more marking laser in another room off to the right, and the
metal-cutting laser is to your left. They also have a bit of storage in
the corner for commonly used materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/5333861475/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Interlock tours Smidgens 2" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5166/5333861475_cae8c0e05a.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 333px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They had three lasers like the above, and these mostly do wood and
acrylic cutting and etching. I failed to shoot the 8-ish foot long laser
tube, the massive power supply, and the ridiculously beefy stepper
(servo?) motors driving the XY tables. So sorry. It really made the
nerds go all giggity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/5333840359/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Marilyn Toast" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5041/5333840359_742bd8ed24.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 333px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bread. Dried, lasered, lacquered. It's a miracle! Rita does some fun
stuff with the lasers that I'm sure their engineers hadn't anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/5334435084/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Marking Machine" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5010/5334435084_1e22090647.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 333px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This machine was solely for cutting thin materials or marking things at
an insane speed. Instead of moving the entire workpiece or optics in an
XY fashion, it has two mirrors that remain stationary and just twiddle
the beam to and fro. The design you see above took about ten or fifteen
seconds to cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/5333865857/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mill Parts" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5289/5333865857_8d8ede5901.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 333px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here are the parts! Time for assembly... soon enough we'll be
milling circuit boards in-house at Interlock. Thanks again, Gary, for
cutting our parts and taking the time to show us your lasers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wanted to watch a hard drive get shredded in seconds, see
a box of RAM that was 800 pounds, or wander through a 100,000 square
foot grave yard of electronics? So did we, and our tour of Regional
Computer Recycling and Recovery was just that. RCR&amp;amp;R is one of the major
electronics recyclers in the Rochester area, and we were lucky enough to
get a tour of their facilities.&amp;nbsp;They outlined the process from beginning
to end of how a computer is received, processed, parted out, and
eventually recycled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="rotating knives sign" class="photo left" src="/wp-uploads/2010/12/rotatingknivessm-297x300.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of us were guided around the RCR&amp;amp;R facility after learning about
the organization. Vice president Charlie McKernen teamed up with client
service representative Tom Smith to show us the&amp;nbsp;facility, answer our
questions, and keep us on track when our attention strayed to the many
items sitting on the giant shelves.&amp;nbsp;One of the first stops was a hard
drive shredder which chopped through the devices like butter, leaving
just a pile of scraps after a few sparks. We walked by workers parting
out the computers, placing each into a corresponding box that would
eventually be shipped out for recycling by a facility specifically
designed to process that part. Charlie was able to&amp;nbsp;easily&amp;nbsp;answer our
questions on&amp;nbsp;degaussing&amp;nbsp;and secure hard drive&amp;nbsp;wiping&amp;nbsp;methods, and they
all seemed to be up to speed on the latest compliance requirements and
best practices when it came to security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tour&amp;nbsp;happened&amp;nbsp;on the same day that the Democrat and Chronicle
published &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.democratandchronicle.com/article/20101227/NEWS01/12270323/1002/NEWS/Effort-aims-to-cut-waste-electronics"&gt;an
article&lt;/a&gt;
discussing a New York State law touting a state wide, free e-waste
recycling program. Passed in May, the law will make electronics
manufacturers responsible for the waste generated when a computer is
recycled. Current NYS law allows computers to be thrown out as part of
your regular trash, leaking contaminants into the ground.
Hazardous&amp;nbsp;metals like lead and mercury, and the chemicals that make
plastics flame retardant can cause damage to the environment. The new
law aims to get consumers recycling their old electronics by offsetting
the cost back to the manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can visit the RCR&amp;amp;R &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ewaste.com"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; for more
information about their facility and services, and be sure to check out
their &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://stores.ebay.com/Electronics-Cafe"&gt;Electronics Cafe&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Their facility is 100,000 sqft in Victor and their Central Ave.
location is 20,000 sqft.&lt;/p&gt;

this wasn't the original date of our inception, it was the agreed upon
time to meet, discuss what we did the year before, announce plans for
the year after, decide upon the budget, and share ideas that could help
improve Interlock as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first year was packed with tasks necessary for putting together a
hackerspace from the ground up. &amp;nbsp;Starting out, we were a group of people
meeting in a coffee shop with an idea and we quickly transitioned into
getting a space to call home, incorporating the organization and
designing the bylaws for the group. &amp;nbsp;We worked with community leaders to
attend events like Barcamp Rochester and partnered up with our friends
at CoWorking Rochester for lightning talks. And in between all of that,
we tried to make time for our personal projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was fun to hear what members had been working on in the space this
year. Arduinos, Apple 2c+ hacking, knitting, networking, photography,
infosec, robotics, ham radio, makerbot plans, virtualization, lock
picking, phone systems, classes,&amp;nbsp;aerial&amp;nbsp;photography, are just a few of
the projects we worked on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This coming year, we have some exciting new ideas for everyone &amp;nbsp;and the
members have even more ideas for their own projects. &amp;nbsp;Some of those
ideas are about improving Interlock for the public and our community
like offering different membership options. &amp;nbsp;We're also working on ideas
for a project we can work on as a group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally as part of our business planning, we reviewed our financial
situation and approved a budget. &amp;nbsp;You can take a look at our costs and
where the money goes from 2010 below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2010/12/2010_expenses.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Financial numbers for 2010" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-306" src="/wp-uploads/2010/12/2010_expenses-300x124.png" style="width: 300px; height: 124px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A thanks goes out to all of our members and friends who donate their
time, money, and ideas to our cause. &amp;nbsp;We seriously couldn't have done it
without you.&lt;/p&gt;

we recently applied for a club station license to give Interlock its
very own call sign. The paperwork arrived last night and we're pleased
to announce that Interlock now has an official presence on the air. The
aptly named call sign, K2HAX, has also been applied for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are currently VHF/UHF capable using a homemade J-Pole antenna. Our
roof antenna project is progressing nicely and, despite a few snags, the
necessary supplies will soon be ordered in hopes of being functional
before the city experiences any significant snowfall. When all is said
and done, we will have a fairly powerful ham station capable of reaching
the far edges of Monroe County and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upcoming projects include using modified Motorola Bravo pagers for
paging over ham frequencies, and setting up a WinLink node to allow for
e-mailing over ham radio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like to take this course but were unable to attend the
first class, fret not! You can catch up by reading the &lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2010/10/basic-electronics-class-1.pdf"&gt;lecture
notes&lt;/a&gt;,
and there will be plenty of knowledgeable individuals to answer
questions after the class or during the course labs on Thursday nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course continues this Tuesday, October 19th at 8:00PM, and will go
into further detail about how each component works and how they function
within a circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
