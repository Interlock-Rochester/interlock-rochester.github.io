&lt;p&gt;Today was the 2016 Rochester Mini Maker Faire in the Riverside
Convention Center. &amp;nbsp;We had a blast, and hope you all did too. &amp;nbsp;As you

can see in the photos, we had quite the nice spread of things we were

of these will become links in the future, as we add more detailed
descriptions about the projects... &amp;nbsp;(from left to right)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R.U.D.I. -&amp;nbsp;Rudimentary Utility Droid Intelligence from Bill&amp;nbsp;HK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raspberry Pi Backup Server - Carl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merlin-duino - Arduino Pro Mini and RGB LEDs in a 1980s Merlin game -
Scott&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amibian - RasPi running the UAE Amiga Emulator and our info slideshow
- Scott&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LED Interlock Sign - &amp;quot;Interlock&amp;quot; in bright friendly letters - Carl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walter - Motion Capture Puppet in Technic Lego, etc - Scott&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friendly Plastic - Low-melting-temperature moldable plastic - Joe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a brief recap of our experiences with the event...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We ran out of 160 fliers. &amp;nbsp;I should have printed more. &amp;nbsp;I just didn't
understand the volume of demand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One potentiometer failed hard on Walter. &amp;nbsp;His mouth wouldn't open
correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We ran out of fliers! &amp;nbsp;We had so much interest that all 160 fliers
were gone! &amp;nbsp;(see below for the solution key for the puzzles on the
back!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check-in and interaction with all event people was awesome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dan ran another great event! Thanks Dan!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had 4 members who were there for the full day, running demos and
talking with people. (Scott, Carl, Bill HK, Joe)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH! &amp;nbsp;:D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carl brought a delicious pastry for us all to share, and Bill brought
some refreshing water. THANK YOU!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, it was a great day, and I am super thankful to you all for
participating!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; On the back of our handout (before we ran out of them) were a
few puzzles to do. &amp;nbsp;In case you got stuck on them, or want to check your
work, here are the solutions:&lt;/p&gt;

raspberrypi. I covered going from a fresh pi to working network drive in
probably about 30 minutes of actual work along with 30 minutes of
talking about options for other things to do. There were 6 or so people
that came and for those people, and others that could not make it, here
are my notes on how to do this. It is not a recipe file with step by
step with commands that can be cut and pasted. This is because there are
lots of options and the values I use are going to be different that what
you will need on your network. These instructions will guide you through
this and tell you where to get things.&lt;/p&gt;

to make updates and upgrades to our systems. &amp;nbsp; This has happened
recently with the upgraded wireless infrastructure right here at
Interlock. &amp;nbsp;While this was done about a month back, full production cut
over happened earlier this week. &amp;nbsp;We were using a Meraki (Cisco) based
wireless system. &amp;nbsp;While nice, it had an annual renewal cost that was
unfortunately not sustainable for us. &amp;nbsp;After much research and
thoughtful debate, the decision was to use a Ubiquiti based wireless
system. Here are some action shots of the team installing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2015/05/20150428_193446-e1432343321802.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="20150428_193446" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1958" src="/wp-uploads/2015/05/20150428_193446-e1432343321802-169x300.jpg" style="width: 169px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wonderfully professional install if you ask me. &amp;nbsp;Here is a nice image of
the layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see we have upgraded to having a 5 Ghz AP as well. &amp;nbsp;If you
want to use it please be aware that we have some new SSIDs created.

&lt;p&gt;Hi all! I'd like to formally announce something that we've (kinda) been
working on for a little while now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE INTERLOCK SHELVES OF POTENTIAL AWESOME!&lt;/p&gt;

one of the dev kits that are there, you …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="THE SHELVES OF POTENTIAL AWESOME!" class="wp-image-1954 aligncenter" src="/wp-uploads/2015/05/2015-05-19-21.25.00-300x225.jpg" style="width: 491px; height: 368px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi all! I'd like to formally announce something that we've (kinda) been
working on for a little while now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE INTERLOCK SHELVES OF POTENTIAL AWESOME!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a library of sorts... &amp;nbsp;The idea is this: &amp;nbsp;If you want to try out
one of the dev kits that are there, you can&amp;nbsp;sign them out for your own
use. &amp;nbsp;Preferrably something that you will write a blog post for. ;) &amp;nbsp;but
even if you just want to sit down with one and mess with it for a week
or two, go for it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a list of what's currently available on the shelf:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://tinyurl.com/ks6gdtu"&gt;http://tinyurl.com/ks6gdtu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that list you will find an inventory ID that matches the ID on the
tag attached to each package. &amp;nbsp;You will also find a contact person who
may be able to help or at least point you in the right direction for
what these things are, how to use them, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, these items are borrow-only. &amp;nbsp;We are working on a way for these
items to be purchasable in the future. &amp;nbsp;For example, if you start using
one, and integrate it into your awesome project, we would like for there
to be a way for you to purchase it from the space. If there's something
you want to borrow, contact Scott to check it out. We'll eventually have
some sort of fancy computer-assisted self-operated inventory system, but
for now, we'll go with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are looking for more borrow-donations for the shelf! If you have
more, please let us know! &amp;nbsp;I'd like to make more Arduino boards
available, as well as modernish laptops and possibly retro computers for
people to borrow and play with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the near future, I will be setting up a laptop or two with a guest
account to be stored there for borrowing in case you want to work on
something at the space but forgot your own kit at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a CD case disguised as a &amp;quot;1997 MSDN Subscription&amp;quot; box.
&amp;nbsp;This is currently filled with empty disc sleeves, but in the future, it
will be populated with various install media for various old and new
hardware. &amp;nbsp;I will be bringing in disc media for some obsolete systems to
be put in there. I'd like for one of you Linux Master Craftspeople to
burn a copy or two of the current preferred
desktop/server/32/64/whatever discs to be stored in there. &amp;nbsp;We will
catalog the contents as things get added.&lt;/p&gt;

here... &amp;lt;http://day.arduino.cc&amp;gt;`__*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be running an Arduino project challenge contest! Using an
Arduino (or related micro), along with any resources and tools in the
Interlock space, and/or materials you bring yourself,&amp;nbsp;what cool thing
can you build? &amp;nbsp;Some old hardware (printers, scanners, misc parts) will
be available to take apart... Judging will happen at 9:30, points will
be awarded for usefulness, niftiness, artistic quality, and technical
depth... &amp;nbsp; The winner(s) will get something, to be determined. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the day, we'll have the doors open for all who want to visit
and participate, or just check us and our space out. We'll be around all
day to help you with your Arduino project, or get help from you on our
projects! ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:00 am - Doors open, Coffee will be available, get settled in, get to
know each other. Project workshop time as well (throughout the day)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11:00 am - Intro to Arduino - What it is, how to use it, some basic
interfacing with buttons and lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noon - Lunch! &amp;nbsp;Sub sandwiches and beverages will be available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1:00 pm - Project Circus - show off your project. &amp;nbsp;casual presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2:00 pm - Arduino Communications - How to get your computer to talk with
the Ardy, and get them to talk with devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3:00 pm - Analog interfacing with Alex - how to work with other kinds of
peripherals&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been getting into making stained glass pieces, as I've been taking
a class at the Rochester Memorial Art Gallery. &amp;nbsp;One of the tools they
have available there is a light box, which I have used to make the
template for the macaw piece I'm making. &amp;nbsp;I used it to help me adapt a
pattern I found online into something that better suits my needs. &amp;nbsp;I
traced it, then retraced that sketch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The light box also works well to see how things look with light behind
them, however it's not something I can use a lot for this, since my
project is a couple dozen pieces of glass and we have to share the light
box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the recycle pile at work was a couple of old, broken laptops. &amp;nbsp;I
snagged two of them; one with an LED backlight, and one with a CCFT
backlight. &amp;nbsp;I thought that the LED one would be easier to get working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over at &lt;a class="reference external" href="/"&gt;Interlock&lt;/a&gt;, I tore apart the
screens, tossing out the LCD panel, so I was left with just the light
source, light guide, diffusion screens, and control circuitry. &amp;nbsp;Its
control/driver board also managed the LCD itself. &amp;nbsp;There were many test
points on the back, so I applied power to the &amp;quot;LED PWR&amp;quot; pin, ground to a
ground point, then about +5 volts to the BLEN (assuming it to be
&amp;quot;backlight enable&amp;quot;) as well as the &amp;quot;PWM&amp;quot; test point. After futzing with
it for a little bit, I gave up and focused efforts on the CCFT-based
one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slightly larger CCFT (Fluorescent) based one had a single board that
connected to the backlight tube through standard white/pink
silicone-insulated wiring. &amp;nbsp;The board itself had one tiny connector on
one side with a few pins that seemed to have obvious use. &amp;nbsp;V+, which
assumably powers the backlight circuitry, should be connected to +5 or
maybe +12. &amp;nbsp;GND, which of course is ground. Then two other connections
&amp;quot;EN&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;CTRL&amp;quot;, which I guessed to be &amp;quot;Enable&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Control&amp;quot;. &amp;nbsp;A guess
would be to tie these to a logic &amp;quot;high&amp;quot; which might maybe enable the
thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I connected just the V+ and GND to a power supply, and applied power.
&amp;nbsp;Ranging from 0v up through 12v yielded no results. I connected the
other two logic lines to power too, and started ramping up the power.
&amp;nbsp;At around 7v, the backlight flickered on, but then wouldn't do anything
until I brought the power back to 0v, and then back up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a hunch, I figured that the backlight needs a higher voltage, and the
logic stays at TTL levels. &amp;nbsp;Applying the same power to both would give a
possible point between the two where both kinda worked, which is where I
saw the flicker. &amp;nbsp;I hacked together two power supplies, with grounds
tied together, 5v from one power brick, and the V+ to the variable
supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9We5elFk1J8/VFpB9JnXiDI/AAAAAAAAC7w/UR087-rhETA/s1600/2014-11-04%2B22.18.15.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F1.bp.blogspot.com%2F-9We5elFk1J8%2FVFpB9JnXiDI%2FAAAAAAAAC7w%2FUR087-rhETA%2Fs1600%2F2014-11-04%252B22.18.15.jpg&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ramped up the voltage, and sure enough, it would get dim around 7v,
then go full brightness around 12v. &amp;nbsp;It seemed to use about 300mA to
drive it too. Good to know. &amp;nbsp;I found a 12v power brick and.. it would
light for about 20 seconds then power itself off. &amp;nbsp;The 12v brick put out
18v.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I eventually found a brick that worked, so i hooked up two supplies, a
5v and a 12v and it was stable and bright. &amp;nbsp;Next would be the task to
put in a 5v regulator to provide the 5v it needs, so i can run it all on
one single power supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-stT0iwcG9FE/VFpFzcS57OI/AAAAAAAAC8E/5trk7YF5Vsc/s1600/main-qimg-d1e728f2f684a47d10b25686f66e93f9.gif"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F4.bp.blogspot.com%2F-stT0iwcG9FE%2FVFpFzcS57OI%2FAAAAAAAAC8E%2F5trk7YF5Vsc%2Fs1600%2Fmain-qimg-d1e728f2f684a47d10b25686f66e93f9.gif&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="width: 320px; height: 122px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple circuit using a 7805 and two capacitors later, and I have 12v
in, and a backlight lit! &amp;nbsp;I wrapped the circuit in tape (purple because
it was there), hooked it up to a power connector, and reassembled the
case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qaXCEb0O6bA/VFpB9O9cu6I/AAAAAAAAC70/f4be5tcJKVU/s1600/2014-11-04%2B22.59.53.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F2.bp.blogspot.com%2F-qaXCEb0O6bA%2FVFpB9O9cu6I%2FAAAAAAAAC70%2Ff4be5tcJKVU%2Fs1600%2F2014-11-04%252B22.59.53.jpg&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best of all, it all managed to fit within the old plastics. Huzzah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I just need to put something on the diffusers to protect them from
cut glass, maybe a piece of plexi, or even a large Ziplock or plastic
wrap, and I'll be set!&lt;/p&gt;

nature’s most fascinating phenomena. In less than a millisecond, a
kilometers-long plasma channel sinks an unimaginable electrical current
from a cloud to the ground, unleashing vast amounts of energy in a very
short period of time. Nearby observers will see a brilliant flash of
light and hear (and feel!) a shockwave of thunder from the superheating
of the air surrounding the bolt. However, did you know that the effects
of lightning are also detectable as radio signals across thousands of
kilometers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of researchers led by Prof. Dr. Egon Wanke of
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/62539"&gt;Düsseldorf&lt;/a&gt;, Germany,
started the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.blitzortung.org/"&gt;Blitzortung&lt;/a&gt; project a few
years ago. Blitzortung is a worldwide, non-commercial, crowd-sourced
Time-of-Arrival (TOA) lightning detection and location network. Around
the world, hundreds of stations listen for the tell-tale electromagnetic
signature of a lightning stroke in the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_low_frequency"&gt;VLF&lt;/a&gt; range
(roughly 3 to 30 kHz). When a stroke is detected, each station records
the characteristics of the signal and a precise
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt;
timestamp, and then transmits this information to a central server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a probable lightning stroke is detected by multiple stations, the
server uses the timestamps and the speed of light to locate the
lightning strike. If station A detected the stroke at time t&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;,
and station B detected the stroke at time t&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, then the
lightning stroke had to occur somewhere along a hyperbolic curve, as a
time difference of 100 microseconds corresponds to a distance difference
of 30 kilometers. Compute curves for at least three pairs of stations
and they will hopefully all meet at exactly one point. This is the
essence of
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_of_arrival"&gt;Time-of-Arrival&lt;/a&gt;
location finding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to this summer, the nearest station was about 400 km from
Rochester, outside of Philadelphia. This station was still able to
detect a significant number of lightning strokes from Rochester and
beyond! That’s because lightning produces an extremely strong, extremely
low-frequency electromagnetic pulse which bounces between the ground and
the ionosphere for thousands of kilometers, like an atmospheric
waveguide. However, two Rochester-area stations went live in late
summer, providing additional coverage for storms in the Northeastern US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of those stations is in Interlock Rochester’s space in the
Hungerford building. It consists of a custom-built magnetic loop
antenna, a Blitzortung amplifier board, and a Blitzortung controller
board. As of this writing, it has been active for two weeks and has
detected 30,282 lightning strokes, the longest of which was 4,350 km
away! This is despite our antenna being located inside of an industrial
building on the outskirts of downtown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Props to W2NED and the rest of the crew who built &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://rags.rochesterham.org/e-RAGS/RAG_September_2014.pdf"&gt;the other
station&lt;/a&gt;,
located in Naples, New York.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total costs were approximately:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blitzortung PCB and parts (amplifier, controller): €120&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Antenna parts from Lowes: $20 (??)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;STM32F4DISCOVERY ARM board from Mouser: $15&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future improvements include &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:452968"&gt;3D-printing an enclosure for the
amplifier&lt;/a&gt; (and perhaps the
controller) and finding a better location to hang the antenna. While
we’re approaching the winter months and won’t see much lightning until
the spring, we’ve still got
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundersnow"&gt;thundersnow&lt;/a&gt; to look
forward to!&lt;/p&gt;

the best chocolate chip cookies ever. I’ve since had a few requests for
the recipe and I’ve hesitated to give it out not because I think it’s a
secret but because baking is a science and with all science it’s not
always’s easier and I won’t have to hear your complaints about how the
recipe didn’t work for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here are the recipes and the links for where I originally acquired
them. Thank you Alton Brown for teaching me to love the Science of
Baking. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://altonbrown.com/"&gt;http://altonbrown.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice in my image of the recipe they list cups instead of weights for
the ingredients… if you want accuracy and consistency in your cookie
then use the weight measurements… if you just want to make cookies then
consult the photo. For larger view click on the image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My secrets:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I only use homemade brown sugar

&lt;li&gt;I sometimes will use AP flour but find I need to use a little more
than the recipe calls for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use milk chocolate chips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I only use real butter and always fresh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the cookie scoop! Uniformity is godliness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1)&amp;nbsp;Humidity, how loose or compact is your flour, what type of butter
are you using, how many chocolate chips do you want to use, the size of
your cookie scoop, how hot does your oven get, how much patience do you
have, who will be eating the cookies (let’s face it you want to impress
but not everyone deserves the best).&lt;/p&gt;

it's okay. &amp;nbsp;I have a couple of jewelry boxes already, but some things
are difficult to store. &amp;nbsp;Like most women with a thing for jewelry, I
have more earrings than I know what to do with. &amp;nbsp;It had gotten to the
point where I no longer had room in my jewelry box for any new pieces,
and it was becoming more than a little difficult to sort through what I
had, despite having organized them into different spaces in the built in
storage tray in the jewelry box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, it was time for a change,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to make myself a earring storage and display device that I
could set out on the top of my dresser, that would allow me enough room
to hold all of my current collection, as well as expand it and not have
to develop a new storage system anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer came in the form of upcycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went on Craigslist and looked for used windows for sale. &amp;nbsp;I found a
guy who lived not too far from me who had a whole stash of used windows
that he had removed from his home as part of a remodeling project. &amp;nbsp;I
went to see him, had an awesome conversation with him, and bought
several windows from him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose one of the long, slim windows to use for this project. &amp;nbsp;This
particular window measures approximately 40&amp;quot; x 18&amp;quot;. &amp;nbsp;I removed the storm
pane from it, brushed off the loose paint with a stiff bristle paint
brush, and lightly cleaned the glass (I say lightly because I wanted to
keep the rustic look it had. &amp;nbsp;I didn't want it to look overly done up or
commercialized.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step was a quick trip to Home Depot to buy a roll of window
screening and some upholstery nails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my supply run, I came back to Interlock and got started in
earnest. &amp;nbsp;I will fully admit that I did not follow any safety protocols
for this project. &amp;nbsp;I wasn't wearing safety glasses, steel toed shoes,
gloves, a hard hat, or ear protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I cut the screen to size with a dull pair of tin snips I had
laying around, and propped the window on a padded desk chair to nail the
screening on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used a basic claw hammer to attach the screening to the wooden window
frame. &amp;nbsp;I was actually a bit surprised at how easy it was. &amp;nbsp;I tacked one
of the long sides on first, then stretched the screening tight across
the frame and tacked on the opposite long side. &amp;nbsp;I stood the window up
on the floor to attach the short side and then trimmed off the excess
with my snips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took the newly screened window home and placed it on top of my
dresser, anchoring it in place to protect from feline related
accidents/crashes by placing one of my jewelry boxes in front on if and
looping a pair of swimming flippers I have hanging from the attached
mirror on my dresser over the top corner. &amp;nbsp;Improvised solutions people,
they work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once it was in place, I hung each pair of hook backed earrings I own
onto the screening, setting their backs aside into a small bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some pictures of the finished product in place, and covered in
earrings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/12/100_2989.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="100_2989" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1604" src="/wp-uploads/2013/12/100_2989-300x225.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 225px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here are some close-ups of the tacks attaching the screen to the
window frame:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/12/100_2992.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="100_2992" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1607" src="/wp-uploads/2013/12/100_2992-225x300.jpg" style="width: 225px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/12/100_2991.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="100_2991" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1606" src="/wp-uploads/2013/12/100_2991-300x225.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 225px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/12/100_2990.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="100_2990" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1605" src="/wp-uploads/2013/12/100_2990-225x300.jpg" style="width: 225px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All said, it took about 20 minutes to make, and 20 minutes to fill up
with my collection. &amp;nbsp;I have plenty of room to expand into as my
collection grows, I can move the whole thing pretty easily, and if I
wanted to turn the whole thing 90○ and set it on the floor, propped
against the wall, I wouldn't even have to take the earring off and put
them back on, they will just rotate with the window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the total cost of this project was just under $10, so I think it
was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do this same thing with a window with no glass, but I like that
the panes are still in it, it adds a certain je ne sais quoi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you decide to replicate this process, please be careful. &amp;nbsp;If you
don't know what you're doing, or aren't sure if you know what you're
doing, ask for help from someone in the know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Craigslist Hunting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/12/100_2677.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="blank canvas" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1595" src="/wp-uploads/2013/12/100_2677-300x225.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 225px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked it up, like all my canvas's at Ollie's here in Rochester.
&amp;nbsp;Hopefully, it goes without saying that you remove the plastic and label
that it comes wrapped in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to apply the tape. &amp;nbsp;You can do this with just about any
masking-type tape. &amp;nbsp;I chose painters tape because that's what I had on
hand. &amp;nbsp;You can apply the tape in any pattern you like. &amp;nbsp;I chose a
geometric patter, making sure to wrap the tape all the way around the
edges and on to the back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/12/100_2675.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="100_2675" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1593" src="/wp-uploads/2013/12/100_2675-300x225.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 225px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the tape is applied, the painting can commence. &amp;nbsp;This, of course,
is the funnest step. &amp;nbsp;I typically only work with acrylic paint because
it's cheap, easy to work with, easy to obtain, easy to clean, and can be
applied with a variety of techniques. &amp;nbsp;I decided to go with an abstract
theme because this was my first attempt with this kind of art, and when
it comes to abstract, there is no wrong way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, I chose some colors, threw them on a palette, and then
applied them to the canvas at random. &amp;nbsp;You paint right over the tape as
if it weren't even there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I neglected to take a picture of this step, but I'm sure
you can use you're imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After painting the canvas, making sure to extend the paint onto the
sides of the canvas, remove the tape while the paint is still wet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure when you remove the tape, since most of it will be stuck
together, that you don't allow the wet paint on the tape to touch the
wet paint of the canvas or you will end up with smearing that you did
not anticipate in planning the chaos of your abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the finished product:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/12/100_2678.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="100_2678" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1597" src="/wp-uploads/2013/12/100_2678-300x225.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 225px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have the ability to plan ahead, you should attach the picture
hangers before painting, but if you chronically forget that step as I
do, wait until the painting dries, then lay it on a towel or other
padded surface to avoid scratches, and attach the hardware to the back.
&amp;nbsp;I typically use hardware that can be found in any picture hanging kit
from the dollar store or other reasonably cheap retail store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is true with almost anything, you can customize this project in any
way you want. &amp;nbsp;More tape, less tape, defined pattern, no pattern,
abstract painting, realistic painting, whatever you want. &amp;nbsp;The point is
to have fun and create a unique piece of art for very little cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Painting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recently had &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/Rob_Bishop"&gt;Rob Bishop&lt;/a&gt; from the
Raspberry Pi foundation stop by Interlock and give a workshop for a
couple of hours, and as we scrambled to prepare -- attempting to pull
together 20 hdmi monitors, 20 usb keyboards, 20 power supplies, et
cetera -- I kept thinking that it'd be nice to be able to play around
with a Pi even if you've arrived unprepared for such an event. So what
follows is &amp;quot;how to fiddle with the Pi GUI with just your laptop, an
ethernet cable, and a micro USB cable&amp;quot;. We're going to start with a
freshly imaged SD card, hook it up to a Mac or Ubuntu laptop through
their internet sharing capabilities, and use VNC to share the GUI over
the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/8248698572/"&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG_4611.jpg" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8209/8248698572_2f0cac271c_z.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="getting-started"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step we'll gloss over is copying a fresh Raspbian image onto
an SD card. This is covered in great detail at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup"&gt;the embedded Linux
wiki&lt;/a&gt;, where they have
plenty of information on setting up the Raspberry Pi. Go there, follow
along, and insert your newly imaged card into your Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="internet-sharing"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Internet Sharing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we're going to prep our laptop to share its internet connection
with the Pi. I know nothing about Windows, but on Ubuntu and Mac OSX,
there are easy ways to share your wifi connection with any computers
that are hooked up to your ethernet port. We'll take these one OS at a
time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/8247471395/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screen shot 2012-12-05 at 4.25.15 PM" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8478/8247471395_775221feba_z.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 490px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming your Mac is connected to a wireless access point, open up the
&amp;quot;Sharing&amp;quot; control panel in System Preferences. Click on the &amp;quot;Internet
Sharing&amp;quot; option, which is probably grayed out at this point. Choose
&amp;quot;Ethernet&amp;quot; as the port you'll share your internet connection out of, and
then turn on Internet Sharing by clicking its checkbox, which should now
be clickable. Done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/8248822966/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot - 12052012 - 07:15:23 PM" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8197/8248822966_1eae0b1a48_o.png" style="width: 434px; height: 325px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This step is equally easy on Ubuntu (and its variants... I use Xubuntu).
Open up the &amp;quot;Network Connections&amp;quot; system preferences. You'll see
something like the above screenshot. Click the big &amp;quot;+ Add&amp;quot; button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/8248822932/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot - 12052012 - 07:16:31 PM" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8339/8248822932_8d72c9e608_o.png" style="width: 409px; height: 464px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll be confronted with something like the above. Name this new
connection something logical. &amp;quot;Connection Sharing&amp;quot; works for my brain.
Click over to the &amp;quot;IPv4&amp;quot; tab and select &amp;quot;Shared to other computers&amp;quot; from
the &amp;quot;method&amp;quot; dropdown. Some people have reported problems with IPv6 at
this point, so click over to that tab and select &amp;quot;Ignore&amp;quot; in the same
dropdown. Save the connection. Carry on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="plugging-in"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Plugging In&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we should be back on the same page for both OSes. Find the shortest
ethernet cable you can and plug your Pi into your laptop's ethernet
port. Nothing should happen. Plug the USB cable into your laptop, and
then into the micro USB port on the Pi. Before doing so, reflect upon
the fact that &lt;strong&gt;the Pi foundation does not recommend you power your Pi
off of a computer's USB port&lt;/strong&gt;. Your computer might not be able to
supply enough power, and/or might burst into flames. I've not had any
such problems, but if your Pi is acting flaky, or if you're planning on
plugging any USB peripherals into the Pi, you may want to sacrifice
MacGyver points and portability in favor of a wall outlet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="sleuthing-ips"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sleuthing IPs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok. We're plugged in with internet tubes and power. Your Pi should be
booting up and making happy blinkies on its status LEDs. After a short
while, it's safe to assume that it has fully booted and grabbed an IP
address from your laptop. Hooray! Open up a terminal and perform the
following incantations to find out what address it was assigned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/8247609327/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screen shot 2012-12-05 at 6.12.15 PM" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8349/8247609327_22f78a3375_o.png" style="width: 585px; height: 366px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Mac, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;cat /private/var/db/dhcpd_leases&lt;/tt&gt; should pop up a block
of text with the desired info. Above, we got an address of 192.168.2.2.
That's probably pretty standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/8247755603/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot - 12052012 - 07:23:02 PM" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8069/8247755603_c53afc8561_o.png" style="width: 600px; height: 414px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Ubuntu Linux, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;cat /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases&lt;/tt&gt; will get you the
same info. In this case, our IP is 10.42.0.26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ssh-and-setting-up-a-vnc-server"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SSH, and Setting Up a VNC Server&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a few more steps. We need to SSH into the Pi. That is, we need to
connect to a command shell on the Pi so we can install a few things to
get our display up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;ssh pi&amp;#64;x.x.x.x&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Substitute the IP you found previously for all the x.x.x.x mayhem at the
end there. It should connect and ask you for the default password, which
is &amp;quot;raspberry&amp;quot;. Now install the vnc server. This is what will transmit
the desktop environment to your laptop:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;apt-get&lt;/span&gt; install tightvncserver&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the VNC server once, and it will ask you to set a password:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;vncserver&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set and remember a password when it prompts you. I just used &amp;quot;raspberry&amp;quot;
again. I'm creative like that. Now we'll run the VNC server for real:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;vncserver :1&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;:1&amp;quot; is the display number. This is necessary because you could
serve multiple virtual displays off of one computer. But lets not get
ahead of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="installing-a-vnc-client"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installing a VNC Client&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're now ready to install the VNC client on our laptop and connect to
the Pi's GUI. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cotvnc/"&gt;Chicken of the
VNC&lt;/a&gt; is a popular Mac
client. Download and install that as per normal. On Ubuntu,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://projects.gnome.org/vinagre/"&gt;Vinagre&lt;/a&gt; is probably the most
popular client. &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;apt-get&lt;/span&gt; install vinagre&lt;/tt&gt; should get it installed
without a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/8248539760/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screen shot 2012-12-05 at 4.52.36 PM" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8065/8248539760_33c9b1642b_o.png" style="width: 509px; height: 314px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost there. Above is the Chicken of the VNC connection dialog. Fill in
the IP address you found previously, and the &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; display number and
password. Click connect and you should be up and running! On Ubuntu, the
command &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;vinagre x.x.x.x:1&lt;/tt&gt; will do the same thing. Yay! You're done.
Celebrate your hard work and dedication while admiring your glorious
accomplishment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/8248701138/"&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG_4617.jpg" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8208/8248701138_078e58a0be_z.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="extra-credit"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Extra Credit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fellow Interlock member
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://geodesicsphere.blogspot.com"&gt;BleuLlama&lt;/a&gt; suggested a way to
make this process a bit easier the second time around. Rather than
hunting down the Pi's IP address (which is admittedly not very difficult
to do), we can use Apple's Bonjour protocol (aka ZeroConf) to have the
Pi announce itself to the network. I found a good writeup on how to do
this, plus how to get the VNC server to start automatically on boot.
Check it out &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4dc5.com/2012/06/12/setting-up-vnc-on-raspberry-pi-for-mac-access/"&gt;at Pat Galea's
blog&lt;/a&gt;.
You can ignore the part about installing Netatalk unless you care about
Mac file sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you're done with your extra credit, you'll have a Pi that you can
plug into your ethernet and USB ports, wait a minute or two, and it'll
pop up automatically in Chicken of the VNC or Vinagre (or any Bonjour
enabled VNC client, of course).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

decided to break my &amp;quot;never leave the house or have meaningful human

myself to miss the first meeting of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.meetup.com/HackshackersROC/"&gt;Hacks/Hackers
Rochester&lt;/a&gt;, a local group
aiming to mush together journalists, programmers, technologists,
designers, and what-have-you, just to see what kind of nutty/useful
stuff results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/6726571927/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Hacks &amp;amp; Hackers Rochester" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7152/6726571927_7fd2e9714b_z.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get too far, I'll have you know that their next meeting is
Wednesday, February 15th (at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rit.edu/"&gt;RIT's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rit.edu/innovationcenter/"&gt;Center for
Student Innovation&lt;/a&gt;), and you
can get at them on their &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.meetup.com/HackshackersROC/"&gt;meetup
group&lt;/a&gt;, or their &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/#!/hackshackersroc/"&gt;twittery
bits&lt;/a&gt;. If combining
technology and journalism sounds fun to you, you should stop by, because
it seemed like a bunch of smart and interesting people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok. For the rest of our time together, I'm fixin' to dump a few links on
you. I am not a journalist, nor a programmer, but I have been quite
interested in this area for some time, and hope to contribute – at the
very least – as a well-informed cheerleader, brainstormer, facilitator,
or village idiot. We'll see. Either way, maybe I can give interested
parties some ideas of what's possible/probable before the next meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="open-sesame"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Open Sesame&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Open&amp;quot; excites me. Open source software, open hardware designs, open
data, &amp;quot;free culture&amp;quot; in general. Fun things happen when information is
free and accessible. Maybe this first dawned on me when I saw the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://oakland.crimespotting.org/"&gt;Oakland Crimespotting site&lt;/a&gt;. By
now, everybody has seen a multitude of visualizations made by dumping
data on top of Google Maps. Back then it was pretty new and exciting.
What struck me most, at the time, was that the Oakland PD was publishing
this data to a public website, and in a format that was fairly easily
scrape-able and parse-able. Wow! Amazingly pedestrian, really, but for a
city or county government it seemed unthinkable (and still does,
apparently).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many municipalities are doing a decent job in this area nowadays. Some
have even progressed enough that sites like
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.everyblock.com/"&gt;EveryBlock&lt;/a&gt; have sprung up, taking these
public data feeds and massaging them into a format that mere mortals can
make sense of. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://data.baltimorecity.gov/"&gt;Baltimore has an open data
website&lt;/a&gt; that looks like it has lots
of useful info, in easy to digest formats. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://data.cityofchicago.org/"&gt;Chicago
too&lt;/a&gt;. I'm sure there are many
others... those were just the first two to pop up when I poked around
for &amp;quot;data dot blah blah dot gov&amp;quot; sites. There is no
data.cityofrochester.gov site, unfortunately. How do we make that
happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="dumpy-data"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dumpy Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we rely on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.foia.gov/"&gt;FOIA&lt;/a&gt; requests for
information from local governments. Often times, these arrive in the
least convenient format possible, and they are likely full of sloppy and
inconsistent data. We're pretty lucky then, that after cleaning things
up, the D&amp;amp;C often shares this data with us on their
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://rocdocs.democratandchronicle.com/"&gt;RocDocs&lt;/a&gt; site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if they know about &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/"&gt;Google
Refine&lt;/a&gt;? Refine is &amp;quot;a power
tool for working with messy data, cleaning it up, transforming it from
one format into another, extending it with web services, and linking it
to databases like &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.freebase.com/"&gt;Freebase&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot; If you're
dealing with cruddy data of any sort, you should check it out. It's a
bit of a weird install, running as a web server on your computer. Ask
your &lt;a class="reference external" href="/"&gt;local nerds&lt;/a&gt; if you're having
trouble... it's worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="community-data"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Community Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you can get it in a decent format, governments don't always have
the data you need. Or if they do, it might be stale by the time you can
get at it. There are some fun things happening in the world of open data
acquisition. Let's call it &amp;quot;open mapping&amp;quot;, although I'm sure there are
non-location-based projects I'm overlooking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, Google is changing the terms of service on their Maps product...
taking it out of &amp;quot;beta&amp;quot; status and reaching into your wallet for some
payback. If you have a certain amount of map views per day, it's no
longer free to use. Thankfully, all along, a large community of folks
have been creating their own street maps by compiling open government
data (TIGER files in the US), or by walking, biking, and driving routes
with a GPS logger and uploading their tracks.
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/"&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt; is the result, and
it's an amazing feat. Anybody can edit the map... so feel free to liken
it to the &amp;quot;Wikipedia of maps&amp;quot;, even though that probably makes some
people bristle. Not coincidentally, the resultant data is available
under a farily open license, and has thus been mixed and remixed into a
plenitude of other projects, products, and experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.opencyclemap.org/"&gt;OpenCycleMap&lt;/a&gt; builds upon
OpenStreetMap, and highlights cycling routes. It is rather sparse in the
US. I recently attended some public meetings on Rochester's bicycle
plan, featuring some large maps of city streets rated &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; through &amp;quot;F&amp;quot;
for bike safety. Perhaps that belongs on such a map, editable by all
those who actually ride the city streets and know that traffic volume
and speed are not the only relevant dimensions for such a grade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/02/tilemill_screenshot.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-814" src="/wp-uploads/2012/02/tilemill_screenshot.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 389px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.openheatmap.com/"&gt;OpenHeatMap&lt;/a&gt; lets you upload a
spreadsheet of data and crank out a heat map on top of OpenStreetMap.
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mapbox.com/"&gt;Mapbox&lt;/a&gt; is a bit more sophisticated, but costs
some money for hosted maps. No matter... the Mapbox developers have
released &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill/"&gt;TileMill&lt;/a&gt;, a gorgeous
application that lets you handcraft interactive maps yourself. It
requires a bit more knowhow, but I'm sure Hacks/Hackers has plenty of
that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The folks at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.safecast.org/"&gt;Safecast&lt;/a&gt; wanted to map
radiation levels following the Fukushima disaster in Japan, so they
cobbled together some GPS loggers and Geiger counters. After driving
around the country, they plopped the data on top of the OpenStreetMap.
This isn't child's play yet, but every day it's getting easier to bring
together the hardware and software needed to record data and make it
easily available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-brief-aside"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Brief Aside&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These radiation mappers weren't &amp;quot;traditional journalists&amp;quot;. Maybe it
wasn't even journalism or news. Whatever. It was really important info,
and I'll bet no reporter thought &amp;quot;I'll just go out and record that data,
instead of waiting by the phone for an official report&amp;quot;. I hope, after
hanging out at Hacks/Hackers, that mindset will change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semi-related: Rochester has &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://rocwiki.org/Ginna_Nuclear_Power_Plant"&gt;a nuclear power
plant&lt;/a&gt; nearby, and
Interlock has a Geiger counter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(not a terribly well calibrated Geiger counter, admittedly)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some more thoughts on the future of local news and journalism, from
people much smarter and more cogent than I, I will simply link without
comment to some posts I've bookmarked from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ryansholin.com/2007/06/02/10-obvious-things-about-the-future-of-newspapers-you-need-to-get-through-your-head/"&gt;Ryan

free clearinghouse for data feeds. It's ridiculously easy to upload
sensor data to the site, whether it be temperature, weather, energy use,
and so on. Equally important, it's also easy to retrieve that
information as a regularly updated and well-documented stream. Would you
like to browse the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pachube.com/feeds?q=radiation"&gt;2700 available feeds tagged
&amp;quot;radiation&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; on Pachube?
Probably not. But it'd be a relatively simple task to create a program
that retrieves and maps them in an easy to digest format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some folks – mainly in New York City – weren't quite satisfied with the
current status quo of air quality monitoring. So they're &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://airqualityegg.wikispaces.com/"&gt;building their
own sensor network&lt;/a&gt; using open
platforms to measure and make the data available to anybody that wants
it, in real time. This stuff isn't too technically challenging nowadays.
We just need to pair up those with a need for info with the people who
know how to get this stuff done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's plenty more fun stuff happening in this area, but that's enough
to keep you occupied for a few hours a least. If – after you close all
your browser tabs – you still find your cravings unfulfilled, do &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.meetup.com/HackshackersROC/"&gt;join
us at the next meeting&lt;/a&gt;, or
fire away in the comments here. I'm sure we'll be able to fill up or

&lt;p&gt;One way I kept on an even keel during the recent holiday season was by
taking every opportunity I could to practice making these &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.en.origami-club.com/fun/balloon/ballon/index.html"&gt;origami
cubical
&amp;quot;balloons&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;
using scraps of wrapping paper. I made in excess of a dozen, and that
was the high point of my recent kick to practice enough to be able to do
this pattern from memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a maker-theory perspective, even with the digital revolution and
the move to e-texts to replace things, like books, that have
traditionally used paper, paper as a material is still ubiquitous and
cheap. Its ready availability means that one can cultivate the maker
state of mind just about any where--I started out on this recent origami
journey after lunch one day a couple of months ago, using the
coated-paper basket liner at a burrito place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paper fast-food tray liners and place mats do pretty well in a pinch,
and making something then and there is a great way to entertain a
youngster or to open a discussion with an indulgent friend, co-worker,
or even a stranger, about the fun to be had as a hacker and maker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amongst different types of paper, paper sold as &amp;quot;origami paper&amp;quot; can be a
little more hard to find and more expensive. I also try to resist that
tendency projects have to lead off with &amp;quot;first, go out and buy
something&amp;quot;. So I set out to figure out &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://deejoe.posterous.com/recycled-paper-origami"&gt;a way consistently to convert
randomly-shaped scraps of
paper&lt;/a&gt; into
squares suitable for use with traditional origami patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, at my last turn on door duty for Interlock's &amp;quot;Do Night&amp;quot; I
worked on expanding my repertoire a little bit, learning how to make
these
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.en.origami-club.com/traditional/box2/box2/index.html"&gt;open-topped&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.en.origami-club.com/traditional/candybox/candybox/index.html"&gt;boxes.&lt;/a&gt;
Also, Reggie was a pretty ggod sport about taking some instruction from
me about how to fold up his own balloon made from wrapping paper I
pushed on him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I'm not that enthused about making little animals. Also, I had
my paper airplane phase as a kid, so that doesn't hold a lot of appeal
for me at the moment. Mostly, pure geometry, as in the balloon-cubes,
and potentially useful knick-knacks, like the candy box, are what I've
been after. With the holidays gone, my interest may fade for a bit.
We'll see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The build was pretty involved, but with a group of four folks we managed
to get the majority of the work done in one long Sunday, a time-lapse of
which follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That resulted in the following structure, which just needed to have its
nozzle and build platform installed (and quite a bit of wiring).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/6348815574/"&gt;&lt;img alt="RepRap Huxley Build" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6230/6348815574_82a7a5964f_z.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With surprisingly little calibration and tinkering, we finally got our
first fully printed part last Friday, the semi-traditional &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1046"&gt;whistle
model&lt;/a&gt;. The quality is really
good already, and will get a bit better once we tweak some settings and
really get the machine purring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the nozzle is clogged now, unfortunately. So my goal tonight is
to clear that out and get plastic extruding again, and then try to print
out the interlock logo, which you can see above, extruded from a DXF
file in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.openscad.org/"&gt;openSCAD&lt;/a&gt;. Come visit, and bring a
model you might want to print! There's plenty of inspiration and/or

&lt;p&gt;It's true, we've managed to move all of our gear and junk into a new

&lt;p&gt;It's true, we've managed to move all of our gear and junk into a new
space. We're in the same building, but we've now got over twice the
space, and some delineation between a workshop sort of room, and other
rooms that are more office-like. Above, you can see a shot of the new
workshop. It's pretty close to the size of our entire previous space,
and we're excited to fill it up with useful tools and fun projects. The
first step though, was painting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to having more space, we also finally got roof access. That,
plus a particularly motivated new-ish member (Walter), means that we
already have a respectable antenna farm installed up there, perfect for
the roughly 50% of our membership with ham licenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/6359765801/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Antenna Farm" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6214/6359765801_3fce69d5f9_z.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've set aside a whole room for all the ham gear and a secondary
electronics workbench (although it's already surpassing the main bench
as far as sweet gear goes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/6356820667/"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Ham Shack" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6218/6356820667_69192ab54b_z.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The network goons have a server closet now, so normal humans can be
isolated from the constant whine of small fans and hard drives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a large room set up as a classroom or conference room, perfect
for some upcoming classes that are in the works, and nicely isolated
from other noisy activities in the space. I reckon we can accommodate a
dozen people per class, if they all need hands-on desk space, and more
if it's just rows of chairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/6356784025/"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Classroom / Conference Room" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6057/6356784025_38d6222dbb_z.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's more to the space that hasn't been shown here. Three more rooms
in fact... some of which we're not quite sure what to do with. If you
want to see more pictures, there's always &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/interlock_roc/pool/"&gt;our flickr

&lt;p&gt;Surely this will be my last poorly documented project: a hands-free foot

&lt;p&gt;I started out with an old Canon SD1000, with
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/CHDK"&gt;CHDK&lt;/a&gt; installed of course. For
those in the dark, CHDK is an alternate firmware that works on lots of
point and shoot cameras (not just Canon, anymore), and it lets you run
scripts, save pictures as raw files, and tweak every setting you could
ever possibly want to. It's awesome, and I needed it so I could trigger
the shutter via an external button (you basically toggle +5v on one of
the USB port pins).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/6076628007/"&gt;&lt;img alt="DSC_6902.jpg" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6205/6076628007_f98976013f.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 333px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't want to worry about running out of batteries mid-shoot, so I
printed a dummy battery at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.shapeways.com/"&gt;Shapeways&lt;/a&gt;,
ran some wires through it, then tinned and bent over the ends of them to
make some pseudo &amp;quot;terminals&amp;quot;. These went out a hole I drilled in the
battery door, through the lamp, to a simple 5v voltage regulator, wired
up straight out of the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.national.com/ds/LM/LM109.pdf"&gt;datasheet&lt;/a&gt;. This 5v source
also goes through an old lamp foot switch to the camera's USB port, for
the external trigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/6077171350/"&gt;&lt;img alt="DSC_6905.jpg" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6187/6077171350_06cb8350d0.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 333px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I took to the lathe to make an adapter between the weird lamp
thread and standard camera tripod thread (1/4&amp;quot; diameter, 20 threads per
inch). I used a bit of round delrin stock, bored out the appropriate
diameters, and just cranked a bolt through rather than threading things
properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried a few test shots last night, while I put together &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mightyohm.com/blog/products/geiger-counter/"&gt;Mighty Ohm's
Geiger Counter
Kit&lt;/a&gt;. It works
pretty well, but can't really zoom in close enough to document very fine
work. Hopefully it will still be useful for documenting other tasks that
require both your hands in frame. Failing that, I'm sure there will be
other uses for a scriptable camera attached to a flexible-yet-solid
base... perhaps it will turn into a time-lapse-bot.&lt;/p&gt;

toy, a Roland DPX-3300 pen plotter... delivered via ebay from the
magical futurepast of the early nineties. For those that are out of the
loop with the past century, pen plotters are two axis robo-thingamajigs
that basically pick up pens and draw on paper with them. They've been
replaced by wide-format inkjet printers, but they used to be quite
popular with anybody who wanted to plot out maps, blueprints, and other
large diagrams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/5937490274/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Interlock Plotty Pictures 1" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6125/5937490274_0b95dfca21.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 333px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, somehow I caught the plotter bug, even going so far as to learn
a bit of python after finding this neat library called
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://music.columbia.edu/cmc/chiplotle/"&gt;Chiplotle&lt;/a&gt; that handles
the basics of creating and streaming artwork to plotters using their
native language of HPGL. They have a mailing list where they often point
out good plotter deals on ebay, and I foolishly/accidentally purchased
perhaps the biggest flatbed plotter out there. 3x2 feet of plotting
goodness, 100 pounds of steel and stepper motors delivered to my door by
a grumpy UPS driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/5936937271/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Interlock Plotty Pictures 2" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6009/5936937271_0e87fb9250.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 333px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After realizing it doesn't fit anywhere in my house, I brought it to
Interlock and have been tinkering with it since. The first step was to
convert old dried out plotter pens into pen holders that would allow me
to use Sharpies or other art pens with the device. That involved a quick
trip to the lathe, which I hope to document more fully in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/5936918129/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Interlock Plotty Pictures 3" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6006/5936918129_7d4e1d4a2e.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 333px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having figured out an inexpensive pen solution, I really wanted to make
drawings based on webcam input... so I trawled around the internet and
mailing lists until I could piece together a passable solution using
OpenCV's python bindings, and a series of nerdy unixy commands (convert,
autotrace, and pstoedit) to trace, mush, and output the data. You can
find the relevant code up on my &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beardicus/ronald_toys%20"&gt;Ronald
Toys&lt;/a&gt; Github repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/5937423454/"&gt;&lt;img alt="RoboPortraits" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6125/5937423454_df75c66a42.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 333px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having conquered such menial tasks, I decided that the default route the
plotter was taking was quite inefficient, with lots of time spent
seeking back and forth between lines. My precious robot was spending
half its time flailing due to a poorly composed hpgl file. Surely there
was a better way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beardicus/ronald_tools%20"&gt;Tada!&lt;/a&gt; I wrote a
really dumb sort routine that attempts to minimize seeking between
lines, instead of blindly accepting the order that autotrace wrote them
in. You can see the difference in the following two time-lapse videos.
The first shows the default route that autotrace produces, and the
second is my optimized version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next step for this project: some more sophisticated drawing routines,
including some cross-hatched shading, color, and maybe even some 3D
input from a Kinect. Stop in for a Tuesday Open Night and maybe you can
be a robo-portrait guinea pig!&lt;/p&gt;
