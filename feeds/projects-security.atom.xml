BNC is a process that acts in a similar manner to a proxy: I connect to
it, and it connects to the IRC network. The advantage of this, for me,
is that it can stay connected to the network even when I'm not: logging
conversations and messages and holding on to my nickname for me.&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/11/linkinus2.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="IRC" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1084" src="/wp-uploads/2012/11/linkinus2-300x189.png" style="width: 300px; height: 189px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I initially started with a blank slate: an install of Ubuntu Server
12.04 LTS in a virtual machine (thanks to our wonderful netadmin team).
Almost immediately I realized I had a problem though: the VM was behind
a firewall and NAT, with only a single firewall rule and port forward
for SSH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our members recently sent out a message to our mailing list about
doing some cool things with SSH. So I thought it would be a great
opportunity to take advantage of this new knowledge. In order to set
this up, I needed to have SSH open and accessible on another machine.
For convenience sake, I made this the machine that I was going to
connect to the BNC from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this article, I'm going to refer to the two
computers in question as &amp;quot;bwvm&amp;quot; which is the Ubuntu Server virtual
machine, and &amp;quot;bwhome&amp;quot; which is my MacBook Pro on my desk (&amp;quot;bw&amp;quot; being my
initials -- clever, I know).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did was setup SSH keys so that I didn't have to use
passwords when connecting back and fourth between these two computers.
I've done this a few times before but it isn't something I do on a daily
basis, so I followed this excellent guide from Paul Keck on doing so:
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulkeck.com/ssh/"&gt;HOTWO: set up ssh keys&lt;/a&gt;. The gist is that
you generate a public/private key-pair on each computer
(&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;ssh-keygen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-t&lt;/span&gt; dsa&lt;/tt&gt;) and then copy the contents of the resulting
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;id_dsa.pub&lt;/tt&gt; public key file to the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;authorized_keys2&lt;/tt&gt; file on the
opposite computer (i.e. bwvm's &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;id_dsa.pub&lt;/tt&gt; contents go into bwhome's
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;authorized_keys2&lt;/tt&gt; file). Now I can SSH back and fourth freely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next step: install and configure a BNC. At first I started with psyBNC.
I ran into some troubles with that though, in that for some reason it
would only allow me to use super insecure passwords (instead of the
insanely complex ones that I'd generated with
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword"&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt;) and it refused to
connect to some of the IRC servers I wanted to connect to. I spent some
time troubleshooting but ultimately decided it wasn't worth
the&amp;nbsp;hassle&amp;nbsp;and went with a recommendation to use an easier to configure
BNC: ZNC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I got ZNC installed and configured and began the process of forwarding
the port via SSH. The command I'm using to do so looks like this:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;ssh bwhome &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-R&lt;/span&gt; 4242:localhost:31337 &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;When run from a shell on bwvm what this does is links port 31337 on
bwvm to port 4242 on bwhome (which to me is localhost -- the computer
I'm sitting at). So what I can do now is &amp;nbsp;run a
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;/connect localhost 4242&lt;/tt&gt; in my IRC client, and be connected to the
BNC running on port 31337 on bwvm without bugging the netadmin team
for another port forward and firewall rule!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;This is a bit convoluted, but works. At the moment, the process looks
like this (sitting at bwhome):&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;`` &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:me&amp;#64;bwhome"&gt;me&amp;#64;bwhome&lt;/a&gt;:~$ ssh bwvm &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:me&amp;#64;bwvm"&gt;me&amp;#64;bwvm&lt;/a&gt;:~$ ssh bwhome -R 4242:localhost:31337 -N &amp;amp; [switch back to bwhome] me&amp;#64;bwhome:~$ irssi /connect localhost 4242 (BNC password)&amp;nbsp;``&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The result:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;img alt="Yay! IRC goodness" src="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s12/sh/69f51770-2020-4b17-b4a1-2b9c4ff9cec8/804981870bec3e00fb98da354041f354/res/319665fe-898d-4ba9-bb62-63820bff07f6/skitch.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Yay! IRC goodness)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Instead I'd like to simply run one command from bwhome, without having
to initiate a shell session with bwvm. This should be possible by
simply switching some of the command around. To do that it will likely
end up looking something like this (again, sitting at bwhome):&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;ssh bwvm &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-L&lt;/span&gt; 4242:localhost:31337 &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-N&lt;/span&gt; &amp;amp;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;(actually it looks exactly like that)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One distinct advantage of this method (using SSH) over having a firewall
rule and a port forward is an added layer of security: in order to
access my BNC someone would have to be able to SSH into my VM. Note that
I don't have to use SSL when connecting to the BNC, because all of the
traffic is already tunneled over SSH.&lt;/p&gt;
