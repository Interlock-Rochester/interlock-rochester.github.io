| Arduino Day, Saturday, Apr 2
| 1PM to 7PM at Interlock

| 1-2 will be a socializing time when people can come in, meet others,
  have some lunch and discuss electronics projects.
| At 2PM we will have a "Getting Started with Arduino" if you want to
  know what this is all about and how to get started.
| At 3PM we will open the floor to anyone that wants to show off the
  cool projects they have done with Arduinos.
| At any time people are welcome to work on their own Arduino projects
  or help others designing their latest project.
