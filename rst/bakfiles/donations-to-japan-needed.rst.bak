The `Tokyo Hackerspace <http://www.tokyohackerspace.org>`__ is working
with various communities and agencies in Japan to provide relief
supplies following the earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear plant issues.

They are asking the global community to send specific items, which will
then be boxed up into care packages. Runners will then distribute them
to the local drop points for relief efforts. Additionally, they will be
making solar-powered LED lanterns to distribute until the power gets
turned back on throughout Japan.

If you have any of these items, please send them along to the Tokyo
Hackerspace. They are requesting that people **not** send other items
without clearing it through them first; this list was compiled by
talking to several local agencies who communicated their needs.
