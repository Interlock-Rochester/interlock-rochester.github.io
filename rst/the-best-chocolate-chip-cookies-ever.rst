So at our last Lightning Talk at Interlock I shared my secret for making
the best chocolate chip cookies ever. I’ve since had a few requests for
the recipe and I’ve hesitated to give it out not because I think it’s a
secret but because baking is a science and with all science it’s not
always’s easier and I won’t have to hear your complaints about how the
recipe didn’t work for you.

So here are the recipes and the links for where I originally acquired
them. Thank you Alton Brown for teaching me to love the Science of
Baking. http://altonbrown.com/

Notice in my image of the recipe they list cups instead of weights for
the ingredients… if you want accuracy and consistency in your cookie
then use the weight measurements… if you just want to make cookies then
consult the photo. For larger view click on the image.

**My secrets:**

-  I only use homemade brown sugar
   http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/homemade-dark-brown-sugar-recipe/index.html
-  I sometimes will use AP flour but find I need to use a little more
   than the recipe calls for.
-  I use milk chocolate chips
-  I only use real butter and always fresh
-  Use the cookie scoop! Uniformity is godliness.

(1) Humidity, how loose or compact is your flour, what type of butter
are you using, how many chocolate chips do you want to use, the size of
your cookie scoop, how hot does your oven get, how much patience do you
have, who will be eating the cookies (let’s face it you want to impress
but not everyone deserves the best).
