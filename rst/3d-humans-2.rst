We've been tinkering lately with taking pictures for `the Open Crowd
Project <http://www.theopencrowdproject.com/>`__, an effort to create a
3D printed crowd of humanoids. It really doesn't take much effort, nor
much equipment. You just submit a series of photos of your model (`photo
guidelines <http://www.theopencrowdproject.com/participate/>`__), upload
them to the project, and sit back while fancy software (mostly `123D
Catch <http://www.123dapp.com/catch>`__) and diligent humans
painstakingly render your likeness in bits and bytes and plastic blobs.

The model shown here isn't their best work, as we provided sub-par
imagery for our first attempt. We're submitting some better shots now,
so we'll see if our process has improved enough to give some higher
resolution models. Once we're good to go and have this process down, you
should feel free to stop in sometime and get yourself digitized!
