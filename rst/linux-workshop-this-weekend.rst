We are holding a Linux Workshop this Saturday, March 20 from noon to
4PM.

If you've never been to the Linux Workshops in the past they're a lot of
fun and a great way to learn something new!Â  Everyone is welcome!

Experts will be on hand to help with any Linux questions or problems you
might have. So bring in your computer and let us help you get the most
out of it. Or come and answer questions for others.
