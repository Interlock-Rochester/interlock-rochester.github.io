We'll be continuing our seminar series showing the basics of various
tools for each of Interlock's interest groups. In October, we'll have
our first How Do I (HDI) related to security -- Burp Suite.

    Burp Suite is an HTTP/HTTPS proxy tool that can help you better
    understand how a web application works. Designed for security, it
    allows anyone to man-in-the-middle(MITM) web traffic, learn how a
    web application works, and manipulate the traffic to see how the
    application responds. Uses include:

    | - debugging your web application to find why it doesn't work
    | - identifying and exploiting security vulnerabilities
    | - using it to inspect mobile traffic
    | - answering the question ... "I wonder how that works"

    The seminar will start with a basic presentation about the Burp
    Suite tools which is provided free to download.[0] The class will
    walk through identifying vulnerabilities in a demo web site. All
    attendees are expected to bring a laptop (Linux, OSX, or Windows) or
    coordinate borrowing one before the workshop. If you have the ram to
    support it, it's also recommended you run Vmware Player /
    Workstation / Fusion on your system.

If you're interested, please RSVP on the meetup site below. As always,
the workshop is open to the public for free. Please consider dropping a
few dollars in the donation bucket.
