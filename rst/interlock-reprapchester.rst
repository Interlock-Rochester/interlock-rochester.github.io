|First Print!|

We've got a 3d printer! It's still a bit "in progress" as far as
building and tuning it goes, but anybody interested in small-scale
hobby-level 3d printing should stop in to ogle as our new
`eMaker <http://www.emakershop.com/>`__ `Huxley
RepRap <http://reprap.org/wiki/Huxley>`__ prints out whistles and
gadgets and geegaws all night long.

The build was pretty involved, but with a group of four folks we managed
to get the majority of the work done in one long Sunday, a time-lapse of
which follows:

That resulted in the following structure, which just needed to have its
nozzle and build platform installed (and quite a bit of wiring).

With surprisingly little calibration and tinkering, we finally got our
first fully printed part last Friday, the semi-traditional `whistle
model <http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1046>`__. The quality is really
good already, and will get a bit better once we tweak some settings and
really get the machine purring.

I think the nozzle is clogged now, unfortunately. So my goal tonight is
to clear that out and get plastic extruding again, and then try to print
out the interlock logo, which you can see above, extruded from a DXF
file in `openSCAD <http://www.openscad.org/>`__. Come visit, and bring a
model you might want to print! There's plenty of inspiration and/or
finished "things" on `Thingiverse <http://www.thingiverse.com/>`__ if
you don't know where to start, and we'll have a class soon on how to go
from and idea to a 3d print... so stay tuned!
