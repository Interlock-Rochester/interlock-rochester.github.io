`Congresswoman Louis Slaughter <http://www.louise.house.gov/>`__ visit
to Interlock centered around the idea that a small group of people can
make an impact and rediscover the future. I may be embellishing a little
but I do think there was a sense that even if we did not always agree
that the conversation is always worth having. The 3D printers were a big
hit as they usually are and Skip was on hand to demonstrate a few of his
“little” projects.

Here Skip shows how the 3D printed prosthetic hand works to the
Congressman. The hands are being made for e-NABLE an organization
networking volunteers using 3D printers to make and give hands to
children\ `. <https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/34056332/Alex.jpg>`__
