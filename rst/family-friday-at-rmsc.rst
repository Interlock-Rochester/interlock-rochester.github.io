Interlock brought five demonstrations to our table at the `Rochester
Museum & Science Center <http://www.rmsc.org/>`__ Friday, July 19, 2013.

This was noon to 4 for the *Make It!* installment of their summer
`Family
Fridays <http://www.rmsc.org/Experiences/FamilyPrograms/FamilyFridays/>`__
series.

From left to right, we see the
`MacGyverbot <http://interlockroc.org/author/macgyvrbot/>`__ Printrbot
LC generously lent for this demonstration but often seen in operation at
Interlock, the `Interlock
Huxley <http://interlockroc.org/2011/12/06/interlock-reprapchester/>`__
`RepRapPro <http://reprappro.com/products/huxley/>`__ 3D printer, a blue
and white lunch-sized slow cooker keeping some `Polycaprolactone (PCL)
hand-moldable <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycaprolactone>`__ and
`3D-printable thermoplastic <http://reprap.org/wiki/Polycaprolactone>`__
(`previously <http://interlockroc.org/2011/12/01/dashing-through-the-thermoplastic-2/>`__)
warm and ready to try for free-form molding, the `shoebox
regatta <http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:116005>`__ demonstration (with
special guest `Mr. Jaws! <http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14702>`__),
and at the far edge, a solderless breadboard with a temperature
comparator demonstration featuring two `LM35 temperature
sensors <http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm35.pdf>`__ picked up
recently from `College Home
Hardware <http://www.homehardware.ca/en/dealer-microsites/1381-7/contact-information.htm#>`__
in `Toronto <http://goo.gl/maps/7Cga8>`__.

We shared that portion of the first floor with some folks from `Greater
Rochester Robotics <http://www.team340.org/>`__, who brought the robot
from their most recent FIRST Robotics Competition season, `Ultimate
Ascent. <http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc/2013-game>`__ They
were letting visitors move the robot around the floor and occasionally
launch a plastic flying disk or two.

It wasn't quite the battle of the bots, but a couple of times the 'bot
got up a good head start and whacked into the front of our table,
sloshing around the water in the PCL crock and the regatta box. Midway
through, such a collision *might* have had a role to play in loosening
up the Huxley's X-axis drive gear (now since fixed), at which point we
switched from printing in silver-gray PLA (polylactic acid) on the
Huxley to printing in fluorescent yellow ABS
(acrylonitrile/butadiene/styrene) on the MacGyverbot. This led us to
discover that kids love them some bright plastic sharks.
