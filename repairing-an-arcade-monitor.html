<p>I won't lie to you. &nbsp;Having an arcade machine is a lot of fun. &nbsp;I used
to have about 6 of them, but I'm down to two, due to space restrictions
and general sanity. &nbsp;The two that I still have are a TRON Mini/Cabaret,
and a generic full-size cabinet into which I can put one of a few game
motherboards that I have. (Dig Dug, Mortal Kombat, Klax, Rampart, and a
few others.) &nbsp;But one of the less&nbsp;glamorous&nbsp;sides of collecting machines
is troubleshooting and repairing these 30 year old beasts.</p>
<p>I bought the Tron Mini in the late 90s as an empty cabinet. &nbsp;I was
having a difficult time back then finding an affordable Tron
board/control set to install, so I instead put Satan's Hollow into it.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ts-AO60eYo8/UPbSm_i9GtI/AAAAAAAACKo/IF8KBNpNU80/s1600/20001107_0011.jpg"><img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ts-AO60eYo8/UPbSm_i9GtI/AAAAAAAACKo/IF8KBNpNU80/s400/20001107_0011.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 400px;" /></a></p>
<p><em>Tron Cabaret cabinet with Satan's Hollow - Note the red joystick and
white &quot;shield&quot; button instead of the standard blue stick and spinner
from Tron.</em></p>
<p>Over time, I found all of the parts needed including a few tricks to
restore this. &nbsp;When I put the Satan's Hollow boardset in, I
rewired/hacked/brutalized the wiring in the cabinet to&nbsp;accommodate&nbsp;SH.
&nbsp;Although SH used the same boardset, the controls were wired
differently. &nbsp;Once I got the Tron board, and realized how rare this
machine really is, I re-wired it using a wire harness from a junked Tron
machine. &nbsp;I also found the correct power supply to install, repaired by
a fellow collector. &nbsp;The controls were also out of another junked
machine. &nbsp;Over time, I got the machine as restored as I could get it.</p>
<p>Tron uses a boardset, three boards connected together, from Bally/Midway
called &quot;MCR-2&quot;. &nbsp;It consists of a CPU/Program board, a Video/Graphics
board, and a Sound/IO board. &nbsp;Midway used this boardset for a few games,
including Tron, Satan's Hollow, Two Tigers, and a couple other ones. &nbsp;If
you have a ROM programmer (which I do), you can buy one of the cheaper
boardsets to use as a replacement for one of the more desirable
machines. &nbsp;Tron boardsets, when I was last looking, sold for about
$75-$150. &nbsp;Two Tigers sold for about $40. &nbsp;The boardset I have Tron
running on right now is a Two Tigers boardset.</p>
<p>When restoring a game, there's a line to walk with respect to what parts
to put into it. &nbsp;This machine has some vinyl veneer on the sides, which
are somewhat damaged. &nbsp;It also has a fair bit of wear on the front edge
of the control panel. &nbsp;I could have tracked down a
replacement/reproduction for these parts, but I'd rather keep it factory
original. &nbsp;It's not like the damage is too severe for either issue. &nbsp;I'm
actually very happy with the overall condition.... &nbsp;except for the
monitor.</p>
<p>The cabaret/mini cabinet uses a 13&quot; monitor, compared with the
full-size's 19&quot; monitor. &nbsp;The monitor on this one showed a wavy haze,
distorting the image a little, and mucking with the brightness across
the screen, which <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YytR8kJBrPw">you can kinda see in this
video</a>.</p>
<div><p>I was given a solution&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.umlautllama.com/Image/2001/01/cap/">about 11 years
ago</a>, involving
modifying one of the boards in the monitor (the &quot;neck board&quot;, which
connects directly to the back of the picture tube) but never did it, and
lost the parts a few years ago. &nbsp;I instead&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.amusementsplus.com/">bought a &quot;cap kit&quot; from
Amusements Plus&nbsp;around 3 years ago</a>,
and decided to&nbsp;install&nbsp;it. &nbsp;The last time I did one of these was in
2001, so it's been some time.</p>

<p><em>Love that desoldering iron! &nbsp;The pump just clears out all of the solder
super fast!</em></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gcGkwIIbCms/UPbVvRPQguI/AAAAAAAACLU/5TOutBy7rnc/s1600/2013-01-15+22.08.33.jpg"><img alt="image3" class="aligncenter" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gcGkwIIbCms/UPbVvRPQguI/AAAAAAAACLU/5TOutBy7rnc/s640/2013-01-15+22.08.33.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /></a></p>
<p><em>All of the caps in the cap kit have been replaced. &nbsp;Shiny new caps on
the board. &nbsp;Old, dusty, puffy caps in the plastic bag. &nbsp;I'm not entirely
sure why I kept them...</em></p>
<p>Thanks to the awesome desoldering tool
at&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="/">Interlock</a>, I was able to do this in
about 45 minutes, rather than the 3 hours it took me years ago.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9CZk6B8II_g/UPbWLVXCodI/AAAAAAAACLc/lNHRuaus464/s1600/2013-01-15+23.41.43.jpg"><img alt="image4" class="aligncenter" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9CZk6B8II_g/UPbWLVXCodI/AAAAAAAACLc/lNHRuaus464/s640/2013-01-15+23.41.43.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /></a></p>
<p><em>The board is mounted into the monitor framework, and reconnected to the
picture tube.</em></p>
<p><em>|image5|</em></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kOw2tsVd-hY/UPbXzemPFaI/AAAAAAAACMA/cexxzopC0Ms/s1600/2013-01-16+01.11.27.jpg"><img alt="image6" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kOw2tsVd-hY/UPbXzemPFaI/AAAAAAAACMA/cexxzopC0Ms/s320/2013-01-16+01.11.27.jpg" style="width: 239px; height: 320px;" /></a></p>
<p><em>Just about all of these knobs needed to be tweaked to get the picture
looking its best!</em></p>
<p>After some calibration of adjusting all of the controls (focus and drive
on the flyback transformer, and R/G/B Drive and Cutoffs on the neck
board), the picture looked better than it has ever looked before! Which
you can't really tell from these pictures, but trust me, the picture is
sharp, colors bright, and the imagery is stable. It's like it's a new
monitor!</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JX1z847H4jI/UPbW4VBYEjI/AAAAAAAACLk/dupw1sy-okw/s1600/2013-01-15+23.49.41.jpg"><img alt="image7" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JX1z847H4jI/UPbW4VBYEjI/AAAAAAAACLk/dupw1sy-okw/s640/2013-01-15+23.49.41.jpg" style="width: 478px; height: 640px;" /></a></p>
<p><em>The boardset I had in it at first was the Satan's Hollow with my ROM
hack so that it will work as a drop-in for TRON arcade cabinets with no
rewiring at all.</em></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-C9tTnXwNreQ/UPbXP5ca0vI/AAAAAAAACLw/4Fskp5j7TB0/s1600/2013-01-16+00.15.21.jpg"><img alt="image8" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-C9tTnXwNreQ/UPbXP5ca0vI/AAAAAAAACLw/4Fskp5j7TB0/s640/2013-01-16+00.15.21.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /></a></p>
<p><em>Yeah, a horrible high score, but just let me practice and
remember&nbsp;`my old
strategies &lt;http://www.csh.rit.edu/~jerry/arcade/tron/&gt;`__!</em></p>
<p><em>The above pictures were taken before I realized how much dust had
accumulated on the picture tube and shroud. &nbsp;I've since removed the
artwork glass as well as the tinted plexi below that, and cleaned off
those items as well as the picture tube itself. &nbsp;That eliminated all of
the haze, and improved the picture as well!</em></p>
<p>Hopefully, I'll get 30 more years of life out of if!</p>
