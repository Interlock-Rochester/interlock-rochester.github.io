Visit
=====

Come visit the space. Meet the members and community that works in and
around the hackerspace. We don't expect you to be a member, but we'd
love for you to come visit and show off what you've been working on. The
official open nights are on Tuesday, or ask one of our members for a
guided tour during off hours.

Donate
======

Interlock Rochester, Inc. is a registered 501(c)(3) charitable
organization and if you're interested in donating money or equipment, it
is eligible for a tax write-off. To do this, we ask that you come to the
space with your donation, and any member can fill out the donation slip
and sign it for you. If you can't make it in but would like to donate
you can always email treasurer at interlockroc.org to make arrangements.

If you have equipment that you think would be useful to the space,
please understand that we can't accept everything. Examples of things we
would be interested in:

-  Servers, computers, and networking equipment manufactured within the
   last 4 years
-  LCD monitors
-  Electronics parts (e.g. microcontrollers, integrated circuits,
   capacitors, resistors) worth more than $50
-  Tools such as saws, drills, or hand tools. (Please check that we are
   in need of such a tool first)
-  Retro systems (not to be confused with old computers) such as the
   Ataris, Apple IIe, Commodore 64
-  Useful amateur radio equipment like H.T.'s, antennas, or a working
   rig

The following are things that we invariably **cannot** accept:

-  Old computers (>5 years)
-  CRT monitors
-  Random bag of old cables
-  Old printers or scanners

If you're unsure of whether your donation would be accepted, please email
info at interlockroc.org.
