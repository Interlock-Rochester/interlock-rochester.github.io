|BitcoinSign.svg|\ By popular demand, members may now pay their monthly
dues through `BitPay <https://bitpay.com/>`__, a global bitcoin payment
service provider. This is currently a surcharge-free payment method,
i.e. not subject to the 3% payment processing fee.

BitPay payment links may be found on our `Treasurer Operations wiki
page <http://wiki.interlockroc.org/wiki/index.php/Treasurer_Operations#BitPay>`__.

We now welcome **cash**, **check**, **money order**, **debit/credit
card** (recurring, online, and in-person swipe/chip/NFC including Apple
Pay and Android Pay), **Dwolla**, \ **Bitcoin**, and
begrudgingly \ **PayPal**, for any and all payments to Interlock
Rochester. Of these, cash, check, money order, Dwolla, and Bitcoin are
surcharge-free.

You can always find the most up-to-date list of payment methods on our
`Ways to Send Money to
Interlock <http://wiki.interlockroc.org/wiki/index.php/Treasurer_Operations#Ways_to_Send_Money_to_Interlock>`__
wiki page.
