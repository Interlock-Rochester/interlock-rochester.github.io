Have you heard about `Maker
Faire <http://makerfaire.com/newyork/2011/>`__? Probably. Well, this
year, a group of us including three Interlock Members ended up going
down to Queens for Maker Faire NYC 2011.

**AntiTree**:|NYC Maker Faire 2011 A|

Personally I don't really consider myself a maker and have always been
in the infosec hacker realm. I go to hacker cons like Defcon but Maker
Faire was a new intense gathering of super positive people. Where else
can you say you saw a giant hydrolic fire breathing dragon next to a one
man drum corp.

Really the only reason I went down was to volunteer at the
`TOOOL <http://www.toool.us>`__ booth with a couple of friends. I spent
the weekend teaching kids and adults how to pick locks. I'll just say
that I don't hang around kids very much but teaching an 8 year old how
to pick locks was pretty freaking cool. But the highlight of my weekend
was teaching an NYPD officer how to pick a master lock.
