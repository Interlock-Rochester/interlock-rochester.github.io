Interlock will once again be hosting a series of lightning talks this
Friday, February 18th. These are five minute lectures and demonstrations
that cover a variety of topics, and an evening typically consists of
between 15 and 20 of them. This event is free and open to the public,
and all attendees are welcome to present.

While Interlock is generally a tech savvy crowd, no subject matter is
discouraged. Past topics have included homebrewing, chemistry,
bookbinding, lockpicking, artificial intelligence, and plastic bag
management. If you would like to give a presentation and have associated
slides, please e-mail them to info@interlockroc.org, along with any
special accomodations that might be necessary. We love to learn, so
teach us something new!

Our doors will be open at 7:00PM, with refreshments courtesy of our
friends at `Cam's Pizzeria East
Avenue <http://www.camspizzeria.com/locations/eastave.html>`__.
Presentations will begin at 8:00PM, and should last a couple of hours.
Event registration is available at
`Eventbrite <http://lightningtalks.eventbrite.com>`__. Seating is
limited! Visit our `Contact </pages/contact.html>`__ page for details on getting
to our location.
