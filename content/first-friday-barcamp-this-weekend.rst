This Friday, Interlock and the rest of the
`Hungerford <http://rocwiki.org/Hungerford_Building>`__ building will
open as part of the `First
Friday <http://www.firstfridayrochester.org/>`__ art exhibit. If you
haven't visited during a First Friday you can expect a good time to meet
other members of Interlock and explore the building looking for some
interesting art and people.

Also this Friday, Interlock will be hosting the `Rochester
2600 <http://www.rochester2600.com>`__ meetings. An info sec interest
group.

This Saturday we'll be attending `Barcamp
Rochester <http://barcamprochester.org/>`__. This is an event at RIT
that a lot of people will be attending. The idea is anyone can attend
but you must participate by doing a talk.

Check out our `calendar </pages/calendar.html>`__ for times and other events going
on.
