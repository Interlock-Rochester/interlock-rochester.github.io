Some nights when I head to \ `Interlock </>`__,
rather than having one single project, or a part of a larger project to
work on, I have a bunch of little things I want to get done.  They have
the tools and materials I often need to do this.  This past Tuesday was
one such night.  I had four things I wanted to work on, and I got all
four done!

**1:** I like to put handles on things.  My favorite handles are from
Lowes or Home Depot, and are called "wire drawer pulls" as seen in the
image above.  They're relatively inexpensive at about $2, and are simple
to install.  Generally they would be put on drawers in a modern kitchen
or a clinical-type setting, but I like to put them on everything.  If
something is portable, it should have a handle.  I just drilled two
small holes in the plastic parts bin seen above, shoved the screws in
from behind with some washers, and done!  I've used these handles for
portable drive carriers, and other now-more-portable things.

**2:** My son, Jasper sometimes breaks his toys.  I usually am the one
who fixes them.  Above are two wood bolts from his workbench.  The
threaded screws came out of the bolt heads.  I just scraped out the glue
from the holes, and cleaned up both sides with a rasp and some other
things that probably weren't designed for such things.  I added some
wood glue, threw them in these clamps, and returned the screws to Jasper
in the morning.

**3:** I had tried to fix my DLP projector a few weeks back.  There was
something in the light path making half of the image dim such that if
you shook the projector, it would clear up a little. I tore it down, and
right between the spinny color wheel and the mirrors in front of the DLP
chip is this little mirror tube collimator. The glue holding the four
front-surface mirrors to the rectangular metal box had failed, and the
mirrors became loose.  A couple weeks back, I had tried gluing it back
together with epoxy, and it seemed to work, but a new, harsher shadow
was in the projected image.  I needed to get some dental tools, mainly
the little mirror tool, to see what was going on.  Sure enough, this
little guy was aligned incorrectly.  A bunch of futzing with it later,
and it is now fully functional!

**4:** I have been building little breakout boards for my stepper motor
controller-turned-arduino boards.  I decided that for the animatronic
bird project, I wanted to have a way to input joystick data.  I made a
small adapter to go from PC Gameport Joystick to the widget. \ ` I
followed this project
here <http://www.built-to-spec.com/blog/2009/09/10/using-a-pc-joystick-with-the-arduino/>`__ for
the correct circuit -- basically just some pullups on the digital button
inputs, and some pulldowns for the analog axis inputs.  I only wired up
the first X/Y pair as the widgets only have two analog inputs available.
 It was relatively simple to build.  I had built the main breakout board
the night before at home, and i made the orange-wire to Gameport
connector cable at Interlock.  With help from Nick, providing the old
joystick, before I left i had written an auto-scaling display of the
current joystick state.  *More about this to come in future posts*.

All in all, it was a densely packed evening, with four mini-projects
completed.  Huzzah!
