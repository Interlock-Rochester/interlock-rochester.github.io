We were delighted to receive embassy from
`FamiLAB <http://familab.org>`__ during our weekly Open Night on Tuesday
in the person of John S, who stopped by on his way through town. We had
a great time talking about his awesome business making good use of high
voltages, and about all the cool things Familab does, and showing him
around Interlock's new location.

Roboalex is all fired up to lead us into doing soldering classes with
the `MintyBoost <http://www.ladyada.net/make/mintyboost/>`__ kits,
following FamiLAB's example. We'll see how that goes. In the meantime,
it's great to learn that FamiLAB has recently expanded and seems to be
going from strength to strength, including their plans to host the
`Orlando Mini Maker Faire <http://www.orlandominimakerfaire.com/>`__
coming up May 26.
