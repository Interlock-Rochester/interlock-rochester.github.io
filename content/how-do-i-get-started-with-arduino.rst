The class last week went very well but attendance was a little less than
expected. Everyone got a great intro to Arduino programming and simple
circuits. There were no slides but we used these websites during the
class:

https://www.arduino.cc/

https://store.arduino.cc/

These are the official Arduino sites for downloading the IDE and buying
parts that support the Arduino creators. You can buy Arduino products at
other sites for a little less or you can buy arduino knock offs for a
lot cheaper but the arduino.cc site supports the people creating the
platform. Other sites I like to use are

https://www.sparkfun.com/

https://www.sparkfun.com/

https://www.sparkfun.com/

https://www.sparkfun.com/

https://processing.org/

The Arduino IDE contains lots of examples for using the Arduino boards
and if needed they include the Processing code to run on the host
system.
