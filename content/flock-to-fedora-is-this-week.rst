As you might know, Interlock is pretty into the idea of Free and Open
Source Software (F/OSS) and technology and when we heard that Fedora was
planning their annual con, Flock To Fedora, here in Rochester, we were
pretty excited. There are a ton different talks in various categories
including Linux desktop, infrastructure, security, kernel, and hardware.
Check out the schedule here:

There are also some side events happening like the `GPG Key
Signing <http://sched.co/3rLh>`__ event and `amateur radio
exam <http://sched.co/3rKW>`__ session. See you there!
