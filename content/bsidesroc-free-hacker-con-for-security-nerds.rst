booth and showing support. Come visit our table.

What to expect
==============

If you've never been to a hacker con, it's a bit different than your
standard conference. Don't expect the venue to be a hotel. In fact,
it'll be at an old Masonic Temple inside the Auditorium Center.

There will be a lock picking village where the local `Rochester TOOOL
chapter </new-lockpicking-club-rochester-toool>`__
will be around to teach people how to pick locks and the issues involved
with physical security. They'll also be selling lock picks to attendees.

Other stuff for those interested:

-  a dozen or so presentations about information security by industry
   professionals
-  a capture the flag hacker games competition
-  a hacker puzzle to figure out during the con
-  free breakfast and lunch
