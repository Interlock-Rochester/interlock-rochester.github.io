|image0|\ K2HAX is on the air!  With our move to the new space, we have
access to the roof.  On a beautiful fall day, Chris Olin and I put up a
30’ fiberglass mast on a tripod base (not attached to the roof).  Then
we hoisted up a trapped dipole for 10-80 meters and a G5RV.  The dipole
is oriented SW-NE, the G5RV is SE-NW.  We also put up a 2m/70 cm J-Pole
for VHF/UHF.  All the feedlines were run with previously used 8/U down
to our space (about 150’) and into the Ham Shack.

We initially had a Kenwood TS-530s transceiver and roller tuner setup
for HF and we made a few contacts.  We wanted to get the Yaesu FT-857GX
out of the storage container and try it out.  That is setup now along
with an automatic tuner.  Reception seems decent.  We are waiting on an
operable microphone to get back on the air.  Bill, Von, Rowan, and Steve
are working on that.  We will be working on CAT control and a hook-up
for using SDR like functionality with Ham Radio Deluxe, allowing us to
get into the digital communication modes.

The Yaesu FT-8800 VHF/UHF rig is working well, K2HAX normally monitors
146.61 (N2MPE local ARES/RACES repeater) while someone is in the shack. 
We have cables for programming this rig on order and also have a cable
for use with the PacComm TNC for packet, etc.

We also have a desktop PC with a nice monitor setup for use with the
transceivers.  We are waiting on a 2 port serial card to communicate
with the radios.  The remote programming of the radios and the option
for digital mode communications (PSK, Packet, etc) opens up with the PC.

Our bench includes power supplies, frequency counters, various
multi-meters and hand tools.  We have a great selection of soldering
tools for discrete and SMT component work.  We have a variable
temperature iron and a variable speed and temperature blower for
re-work.  On order is a Hakko 808 de-soldering tool.  We have 2 antenna
analyzers, a new Comet and an older MFJ.  Several bench projects are
already underway including Jamie’s whispering clocks, many cable hacks
for the radios, and Walter’s attempts to repair blown audio equipment.

Ham radio is witnessing a rebirth in popularity.  Emergency preparedness
at the county/state/and national level has recognized the value of Ham
radio as the most dependable means for communication during an
emergency.  Interlock members have participated in local POD drills,
Ginna nuclear event practice response teams and are regular attendees at
the local ARES/RACES meetings.  Ham Radio can provide texting, TV and
many other familiar forms of communication without any annoying
infrastructure.  We can DX with Ham operators around the world, by voice
and many new and old digital modes.  SDR is an emerging technology
applied to Ham radio; opening up some fantastic possibilities for low
power operation, contesting, and pulling weak signals out of the noise.

Ham radio is growing in popularity.  Interlock Hams would love to
introduce anyone interested to the hobby and answer any questions you
may have.
