Today was the 2016 Rochester Mini Maker Faire in the Riverside
Convention Center.  We had a blast, and hope you all did too.  As you
can see in the photos, we had quite the nice spread of things we were
displaying and demoing.  Here's a list of things that we showed.  Many
of these will become links in the future, as we add more detailed
descriptions about the projects...  (from left to right)

-  R.U.D.I. - Rudimentary Utility Droid Intelligence from Bill HK
-  Raspberry Pi Backup Server - Carl
-  Merlin-duino - Arduino Pro Mini and RGB LEDs in a 1980s Merlin game -
   Scott
-  Amibian - RasPi running the UAE Amiga Emulator and our info slideshow
   - Scott
-  LED Interlock Sign - "Interlock" in bright friendly letters - Carl
-  Walter - Motion Capture Puppet in Technic Lego, etc - Scott

Here's a brief recap of our experiences with the event...

Bad:

-  We ran out of 160 fliers.  I should have printed more.  I just didn't
   understand the volume of demand.
-  One potentiometer failed hard on Walter.  His mouth wouldn't open
   correctly.

Good:

-  We ran out of fliers!  We had so much interest that all 160 fliers
   were gone!  (see below for the solution key for the puzzles on the
   back!
-  Check-in and interaction with all event people was awesome.
-  Dan ran another great event! Thanks Dan!
-  We had 4 members who were there for the full day, running demos and
   talking with people. (Scott, Carl, Bill HK, Joe)

   -  THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH!  :D

-  Carl brought a delicious pastry for us all to share, and Bill brought
   some refreshing water. THANK YOU!

All in all, it was a great day, and I am super thankful to you all for
participating!

*Note:* On the back of our handout (before we ran out of them) were a
few puzzles to do.  In case you got stuck on them, or want to check your
work, here are the solutions:
