Oops. We've got another pen plotter at Interlock.

|HP 7580B Plotter 2|

I `mentioned
before </2011/09/13/plottopotamus/>`__ that I've
been tinkering with said plotters and webcams and some minimal computer
vision noodling. Eventually, I'd like to implement some of my own
software (likely using `Processing <http://processing.org/>`__) to do
some more in-depth sketchy-yet-robotic drawings.

As such, I had been trying to think of easy/cheap ways to get a pencil
working on the device. A normal pencil will only get so far before it
needs sharpening, and none of my plotters have yet become talented
enough to lumber over to the pencil sharpener. Soo...

Tada! Did you know they make mechanical pencils that auto-advance their
lead? I didn't, until this was mentioned on `a mailing
list <http://music.columbia.edu/mailman/listinfo/chiplotle-discuss>`__
I'm on for discussing the
`Chiplotle <http://music.columbia.edu/cmc/chiplotle/>`__ python plotter
library (and plotters in general).

A quick Amazon Prime-ing of the `BIC AI mechanical
pencil <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I6ZM20>`__ and away we go.
I stuck it into a hollowed out plotter pen, as demonstrated above, and
it seemed to work fine and auto-advance the lead whenever necessary.
Sweet.

So for the two of you out there interested in pen plotters, now you
know. For the rest of you, maybe you've got an
`Eggbot <http://egg-bot.com/>`__ or a `Makerbot
Unicorn <http://store.makerbot.com/toolheads/makerbot-unicorn-pen-plotter-kit.html>`__
or some cool sort of `homebrewed
plotter </2011/10/30/barcamp-rochester/>`__... go
get it running with some genuine [STRIKEOUT:100% lead] `mixture of
graphite with clay binder <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pencil>`__. And
if you're into drawing and/or robots and/or software, you should stop in
and play with the plotters someday. I'll get you started, so bring in
some vector artwork, and maybe some paper, and we'll see what happens!
