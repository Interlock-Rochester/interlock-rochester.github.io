This Saturday, we'll be doing a new kind of event: A garage sale. We'll
be selling stuff in the space now and letting our members come in and
sell their interesting stuff. For example, we have a bunch of servers,
workstations, ham radio equipment, odd electronics, monitors, etc etc.
We really don't know how much stuff we'll have to get rid of.

The point of the event is to raise money for Interlock so things being
sold by the hackerspace go back into keeping the space going, and
expanding its facilities. We are accepting donations for items that you
find around the space.

The second part of this event is that starting at 7:00pm, we'll be doing
lightning talks. You can come for the sales, but stay for the
presentations. Lightning talks are 5-10 minute presentations from people
all over the community about nerdy subjects that interest them. If you
have something you'd like to share, come in and show us!

We'll also be giving you food that our members have made you.

So TL;DR:

-  Garage sale 5:00pm
-  Lightning Talks 7:00pm
-  Food and drinks served
-  Outsiders welcome
-  Help us raise money and clean up the space!
