**If you have access to a 3D printer you can make this!**

|HandleStand, 2|

**This is an Open-Source design, and the STL files can be downloaded
from Thingiverse:  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:64811**

\*    \*    \*

**The HandleStand is hacked from an inexpensive protective case by
adding a pair of 3D printed handles.**

|Stand and case|

As the name implies, the accessory provides both a handle and a stand
function for the iPad, but it is also quite portable, and the handle can
be folded out of the way.

**The assembly also accommodates a shoulder strap, a magnetically
attached "Smart Cover" or keyboard.**

**The A\-Frame stand gets the iPad screen up to a comfortable eye\-level.
 A recent study at Harvard concludes:** *"Head and neck posture during
tablet computing can be improved by placing the tablet higher to avoid
low gaze angles (i.e. on a table rather than on the lap) and through the
use of a case that provides optimal viewing angles."

**"But how can I print a handle big enough for an iPad on my little
printer that has a 6" x 6" bed?" you ask.**

|solvent|

Well the answer is: **"solvent bonding"**...  I use Oatey cleaner that
is sold in hardware stores to be used on plastic plumbing pipes.

\* \* \*

**The trick is to design the device in pieces that are small enough to
be printed, and they\ ** also must fit together precisely**.  Then you
print them in ABS plastic which can be **bonded with solvent to form a
solid piece of plastic**!\* (Please see the WARNING below!)

**With the HandleStand, an iPad can be adjusted to any position about
the horizontal or vertical axis, so it is great for FaceTime or shooting
video.**

The iPad is protected when conveniently carried using the handles or
when on a shoulder strap or when folded and stuffed into a backpack or
briefcase.

****Instructions****

|Hinge set 3|

|Handle set 1| 

|Handle set 2|

 

The iPad HandleStand is made up of parts that are small enough to be
**printed in 3 runs on a PrintrBot LC** (which has a usable print area
of 120mm x 130mm). The plastic parts are solvent bonded to create
handles that are too large to fit on the printer bed.

The Hinge Set contains 2 brackets and 2 sets of A-Frame hinge members.
The brackets are screwed onto a polycarbonate protective cover such as
the Poetic Basic Smart Cover Slim-Fit Case.

|Hinge assembly 2|

**Each bracket is also screwed to a pair of the A-Frame hinge members
with o-rings providing the controlled friction for the hinges.**
Locknuts insure that the hinges stay adjusted and don’t come off.

The Hinge Set takes about 2hr to print on a Printrbot LC with ABS.
Handles each contain 3 handle parts and a Microbeaner, and they take
about 1hr 20min for each to print (for a **total of about 5hr printing
time**). ABS is recommended because it allows the parts to be solvent
bonded together. If PLA or other material is used, then superglue
(cyanoacrylate) can be used to bond the parts.

\* \* \*

A shoulder/neck strap that is made from printed “microbeaners” and
Parachord can be attached.

**Parts list:**

|parts 1|

-(1) Hinge Set (containing 2 brackets and 4 hinge members).

-(2) Handles (each containing parts for a 3-piece handle and a
MicroBeaner for the shoulder strap).

-(1) Polycarbonate iPad case that snaps on at the corners such
as \ `amazon.com/PoeticBasic-Smart-Cover-Slim-Fit-Crystal/dp/B007JBN6NQ <http://www.amazon.com/PoeticBasic-Smart-Cover-Slim-Fit-Crystal/dp/B007JBN6NQ>`__

-(2) Stainless steel 6-32 x ¾” oval phillips machine screw (attach
hinges to brackets)

-(2) flat-head 6-32 x ⅜” machine screw (attach brackets to polycarbonate
case)

-(4) 6-32 lock nuts with nylon inserts

-(4) #6 o-ring provide friction for hinges

-(4) #41 o-ring provide friction against a table

-(1) ⅛” parachord   5’  long

\* \* \*

**Tools:**

-Drill with ⅛” bit and countersink bit

-Solvent to bond ABS such as Oatey cleaner (yellow label white can) made
for ABS plumbing pipe (or use acetone or superglue)... See warning
below!

-Use match or lighter to burn the cut ends of parachord

\* \* \*

**\*WARNING:**

-Use **CAUTION** during solvent bonding!

-Use **eye protection**.

-Work in **well ventilated area**!

-The solvent dissolves many things, and the **wet plastic stains
whatever it touches**!

-Use **latex NOT vinyl gloves**!

-Use **aluminum foil on work surface**!

|BabyBeaner|

**Notes:**

-Use great care to go back and **coat the whole part for a uniform
glossy finish** (especially if parts were sanded), but do one end and
hang to dry (for a few minutes) before doing the other end!

-The solvent can also be used to **heal delaminated parts**, but BE
CAREFUL!

-**Countersink the holes** drilled in the Poetic case so that the screw
heads will not touch the iPad.

-A **large rubber band** can be added to keep the the Ultrathin Keyboard
or Smart Cover closed while the assembly is being carried around.

 

 

**Enjoy the HandleStand!**
