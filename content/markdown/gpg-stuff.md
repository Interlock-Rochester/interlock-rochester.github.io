On April 12 at the Interlock there was a "How do I ..." class on
generating GPG keys and what to do with them when preparing to go to a
key signing event. Then at BSides Rochester on April 23 there was such
an event. Following the key signing event at BSides there was a repeat
of the class on generating your GPG keys.

Now for a follow up to the follow up, Interlock is hosting a Crypto
Party on Friday, May 5 at 7PM as a prelude to the regular 2600 meeting.
So come out on Friday to get your keys signed!

If you missed both classes but are still interested in having a secret
decoder ring of your very own the slides are now available
[here](http://www.interlockroc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GPG.odp).
