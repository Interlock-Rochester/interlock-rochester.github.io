Have you heard about [Maker Faire](http://makerfaire.com/newyork/2011/)?
Probably. Well, this year, a group of us including three Interlock
Members ended up going down to Queens for Maker Faire NYC 2011.

Personally I don't really consider myself a maker and have always been
in the infosec hacker realm. I go to hacker cons like Defcon but Maker
Faire was a new intense gathering of super positive people. Where else
can you say you saw a giant hydrolic fire breathing dragon next to a one
man drum corp.

Really the only reason I went down was to volunteer at the
[TOOOL](http://www.toool.us) booth with a couple of friends. I spent the
weekend teaching kids and adults how to pick locks. I'll just say that I
don't hang around kids very much but teaching an 8 year old how to pick
locks was pretty freaking cool. But the highlight of my weekend was
teaching an NYPD officer how to pick a master lock.
