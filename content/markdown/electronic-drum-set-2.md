I wanted to tell you my progress in making the electronic drum set.  The
drum pads/cymbals/cowbell is a peizzo element sandwiched between 1/4
inch MDF and foam pad.  The peizzo is wired to a 1/4 inch phono jack.
 The drum module was the part that I looked into before starting this
project.  Finally found
[MicroDrum](http://microdrum.altervista.org) that interfaces with an
Arduino and can connect 48 different drums.  It is cheaper then getting
a profession drum module that can do 10.  I am just in the middle of
making foot pedals for the base drum and the hi-hat pedal that is made
out of 1/2 inch MDF, hinge and spring.  The base drum is a peizzo and
the hi-hat is a momentary on-switch.
