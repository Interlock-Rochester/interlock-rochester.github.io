Today was the 2016 Rochester Mini Maker Faire in the Riverside
Convention Center.  We had a blast, and hope you all did too.  As you
can see in the photos, we had quite the nice spread of things we were
displaying and demoing.  Here's a list of things that we showed.  Many
of these will become links in the future, as we add more detailed
descriptions about the projects...  (from left to right)

Here's a brief recap of our experiences with the event...

Bad:

-   We ran out of 160 fliers.  I should have printed more.  I just
    didn't understand the volume of demand.
-   One potentiometer failed hard on Walter.  His mouth wouldn't open
    correctly.

Good:

-   We ran out of fliers!  We had so much interest that all 160 fliers
    were gone!  (see below for the solution key for the puzzles on the
    back!
-   Check-in and interaction with all event people was awesome.
-   Dan ran another great event! Thanks Dan!
-   We had 4 members who were there for the full day, running demos and
    talking with people. (Scott, Carl, Bill HK, Joe)
    -   THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH!  :D
-   Carl brought a delicious pastry for us all to share, and Bill
    brought some refreshing water. THANK YOU!

All in all, it was a great day, and I am super thankful to you all for
participating!

*Note: *On the back of our handout (before we ran out of them) were a
few puzzles to do.  In case you got stuck on them, or want to check your
work, here are the solutions:
