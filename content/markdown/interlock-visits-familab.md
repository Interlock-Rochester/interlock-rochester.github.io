Tonight, I was able to meetup with some of the members of Familab at
their new hackerspace in Orlando, Florida. They've started the same time
as Interlock and have been working hard to startup a cool community of
hackers. The space is filleed with fun toys including a server room,
maker bot, media room, and drum machine.

Thanks to everyone that showed me around. We left them with a gift of a
hand made custom first edition Interlock Rochester Rubik's Cube.\
