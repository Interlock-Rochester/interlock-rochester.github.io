During the fall, roughly September through December, a group of folks
are gathering on Sunday afternoons to knit. Learn how to knit, hang out
with other knitters, share project ideas, or trade yarn! Meet-up time is
roughly 1pm on Sundays at Interlock Rochester, Suite 200, Door 7,
Hungerford Building.

For questions or to make sure the space is open, contact Ryan Tucker via
