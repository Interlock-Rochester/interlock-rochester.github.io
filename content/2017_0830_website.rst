If you're a regular viewer of our website, you'll notice that it's
been going through some changes but it still doesn't reflect what's 
been happening in the space. We're going to change that. 

This coming Tuesday, we'll be holding a website hackathon to get
people into web technologies and discuss various different architectures.
The idea will be that we'll discuss different types of technologies
and ways of hosting the website so that no only do we up-date our
own page, but we'll show you how to update yours as well. 

Our design goals are:

* FOSS Friendly
* Distributed responsibility
* Secure
* Cool

Maybe not in that order.
