It's true. We're starting up a hackerspace in Rochester, New York.
Please check out `our Meetup
page <http://www.meetup.com/Rochester-Hackerspace>`__ if you're already
convinced you need to join us.

For everybody else, the `about
page </pages/about.html>`__ is a good place to get up
to speed with what's going on. In summary: we're creating a space in
which we plan to make cool stuff, teach, learn, and race robots. We've
already found a suitably grungy spot to inhabit:

|The Final Space 1|

|The Final Space 2|

which should be cleaned out and fixed up (by the landlords, thankfully)
by early January. In the meantime we're having some really productive
meetings every Tuesday night, and would love to see more potential
members show up to give their input.

If you can't make the meetings, there are many options for getting in
touch with us. I recommend `our IRC
channel <irc://irc.slashnet.org#interlock>`__, but you'll find more
social-networky stuff on the `contact
page </pages/contact.html>`__.
