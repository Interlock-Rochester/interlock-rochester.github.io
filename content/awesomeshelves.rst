|THE SHELVES OF POTENTIAL AWESOME!|

Hi all! I'd like to formally announce something that we've (kinda) been
working on for a little while now.

THE INTERLOCK SHELVES OF POTENTIAL AWESOME!

It is a library of sorts...  The idea is this:  If you want to try out
one of the dev kits that are there, you can sign them out for your own
use.  Preferrably something that you will write a blog post for. ;)  but
even if you just want to sit down with one and mess with it for a week
or two, go for it!

Here's a list of what's currently available on the shelf:

In that list you will find an inventory ID that matches the ID on the
tag attached to each package.  You will also find a contact person who
may be able to help or at least point you in the right direction for
what these things are, how to use them, etc.

For now, these items are borrow-only.  We are working on a way for these
items to be purchasable in the future.  For example, if you start using
one, and integrate it into your awesome project, we would like for there
to be a way for you to purchase it from the space. If there's something
you want to borrow, contact Scott to check it out. We'll eventually have
some sort of fancy computer-assisted self-operated inventory system, but
for now, we'll go with this.

 

We are looking for more borrow-donations for the shelf! If you have
more, please let us know!  I'd like to make more Arduino boards
available, as well as modernish laptops and possibly retro computers for
people to borrow and play with.

In the near future, I will be setting up a laptop or two with a guest
account to be stored there for borrowing in case you want to work on
something at the space but forgot your own kit at home.

 

There is also a CD case disguised as a "1997 MSDN Subscription" box.
 This is currently filled with empty disc sleeves, but in the future, it
will be populated with various install media for various old and new
hardware.  I will be bringing in disc media for some obsolete systems to
be put in there. I'd like for one of you Linux Master Craftspeople to
burn a copy or two of the current preferred
desktop/server/32/64/whatever discs to be stored in there.  We will
catalog the contents as things get added.
