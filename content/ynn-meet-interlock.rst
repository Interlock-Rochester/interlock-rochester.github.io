This morning a few members stopped by to meet reporters from
`YNN <http://rochester.ynn.com/>`__. Seth Voorhees and Veronica Chiesi
were given the nickle tour, and then chatted with Bill, Von, Brian and
myself. Thankfully they weren't scared away by the level of geek in the
room.

Brian wowed them with his always crowd pleasing custom pen `plot-matrix
printer he's famous
for <{filename}/barcamp-rochester.rst>`__. The
picture above is the pre-printed artist's rendition of Seth holding his
mic.

|image1|\ Von, Brian, and Bill put on their smart hats and answered
questions about Interlock. Von, showed off the ham radio room and his
skills for speaking with human beings. Bill spoke about his background,
why he has been involved with Interlock, and included some razzle dazzle
by printing on the 3D printer.

Brian, with his boyish good looks, sparkled on camera while showing off
his knowledge of all things blinky. I have to admit that while it's nice
to have Interlock get some PR, my first goal in setting up the interview
was to get Brian's face on TV. If you've met Brian, you'll know that
he's a very intelligent, multi-faceted, multi-facial-haired, reluctant
leader. I think that he is a very good representation of what the modern
hacker/maker looks and acts like. But, he's also not the normal talking
head you would see on TV which is why I want to get him out there even
more. I'm giggling right now thinking about seeing him on YNN now.

Feeling bad for the quiet bear-hat wearing man on the couch, YNN even
included me in a quick interview. I worked with Bill and Von on a lock
picking demo that I hope makes to air. Veronica even challenged me to a
lock picking contest where I had to go from nothing in my hands, pick up
the tools, and pick the lock. I surprisingly aced it picking a 4 pin
lock. (Thanks `TOOOL <http://www.toool.us>`__) This will never be on the
air of course.

Thanks to Von Brian and Bill for taking the time to come out and
intelligently represent the group. We don't know when/if the story will
air. Surprisingly, some people have more important things to hear about
than local hackerspaces but we'll let you know when.
