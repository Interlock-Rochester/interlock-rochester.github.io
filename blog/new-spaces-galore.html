    <p>Just thought I'd take some time to catch us all up on several recent
developments beyond Interlock, but somewhat local, that are relevant to
our interests.</p>
<p><img alt="Rochester Brainery logo" src="/wp-uploads/2013/02/brainery-third.png" /></p>
<p>Last month, I read in the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.democratandchronicle.com/article/20130109/HER_GETTING_AHEAD/301090001/Rochester-Brainery">local
paper</a>
of the formation of <a class="reference external" href="http://rochesterbrainery.com/">the Rochester
Brainery</a>, opening early next month in
the Village Gate, across the Goodman Street railyard from us here at
Interlock and our neighbors at <a class="reference external" href="http://thehungerford.com/">the
Hungerford</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Smokestack Coworking logo" src="/wp-uploads/2013/02/smokestackcowork.png" /></p>
<p>We'll always owe a debt to Dave at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.coworkingrochester.com/">Coworking
Rochester</a> for helping us get
started by offering space and moral support during some of our bigger
early organizational meetings, before we settled on a space of our own
to rent. Still, it's interesting to see people coming together in
another coworking space in town, <a class="reference external" href="http://smokestackcowork.com/">Smokestack
Coworking</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://rocwiki.org/High_Falls">High
Falls</a> area.</p>
<p>Here's hoping they both thrive and complement each other.</p>
<p><img alt="Ithaca Generator logo" src="/wp-uploads/2013/02/robotic-logo-like2.png" /></p>
<p>Last month we received a visitor from Ithaca, Jos√©, who traveled up with
a couple of friends maybe to join what he thought at the time was the
closest hackerspace to him. I had a great time talking with him, so it
was a little bittersweet to tell him <a class="reference external" href="http://ithacagenerator.org/">Ithaca
Generator</a> has recently gotten off to
what looks like a good start and might just meet his needs without the
long drive.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I wasn't able to make it to their <a class="reference external" href="http://ithacagenerator.org/events/open-house/">open
house</a> back in
December. But, I</div>
<div class="line">did visit with some family over the holidays who were able to go and
got to see the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.evilmadscientist.com/2008/edge-lit-holiday-cards/">party
favors</a>
they made at the open house. Fun. Look like good things are in store
for the hands-on, DIY hacker and maker community in Ithaca.</div>
</div>
<p><img alt="Buffalo Labs logo" src="/wp-uploads/2013/02/buffalo-lab.png" /></p>
<p>We've also been having a friend, Joe, make the trip from Niagara Falls
every so often to visit, which has had us asking how things are going at
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.buffalolab.org/blog/">Buffalo Lab</a>. Figured we've give
them a shout out while we're at it.</p>
<p>[placehold for eventual <strong>Rochester Makerspace</strong> logo]</p>
<p>Last, but hopefully not least, the most recent big news is a
much-anticipated step for the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.rochestermakerspace.org/">group</a> calling themselves
Rochester Makerspace. They've rented a space a little north of downtown,
on St. Paul Street. Just Tuesday they had <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rochestermakerspace.org/tuesday-meeting-reminder-pizza-0205/">a get-together with
pizza</a>
at the new location.</p>
<p>Though the planning for this new space has been careful and deliberate,
ongoing since at least this last summer, they now are moving towards
ambitious goals to grow fast. I continue eagerly to await the opening of
another maker-friendly space in Rochester, expected some time in March.</p>
