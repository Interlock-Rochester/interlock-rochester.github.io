<p>One way I kept on an even keel during the recent holiday season was by
taking every opportunity I could to practice making these <a class="reference external" href="http://www.en.origami-club.com/fun/balloon/ballon/index.html">origami
cubical
&quot;balloons&quot;</a>
using scraps of wrapping paper. I made in excess of a dozen, and that
was the high point of my recent kick to practice enough to be able to do
this pattern from memory.</p>
<p>From a maker-theory perspective, even with the digital revolution and
the move to e-texts to replace things, like books, that have
traditionally used paper, paper as a material is still ubiquitous and
cheap. Its ready availability means that one can cultivate the maker
state of mind just about any where--I started out on this recent origami
journey after lunch one day a couple of months ago, using the
coated-paper basket liner at a burrito place.</p>
<p>Paper fast-food tray liners and place mats do pretty well in a pinch,
and making something then and there is a great way to entertain a
youngster or to open a discussion with an indulgent friend, co-worker,
or even a stranger, about the fun to be had as a hacker and maker.</p>
<p>Amongst different types of paper, paper sold as &quot;origami paper&quot; can be a
little more hard to find and more expensive. I also try to resist that
tendency projects have to lead off with &quot;first, go out and buy
something&quot;. So I set out to figure out <a class="reference external" href="http://deejoe.posterous.com/recycled-paper-origami">a way consistently to convert
randomly-shaped scraps of
paper</a> into
squares suitable for use with traditional origami patterns.</p>
<p>More recently, at my last turn on door duty for Interlock's &quot;Do Night&quot; I
worked on expanding my repertoire a little bit, learning how to make
these
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.en.origami-club.com/traditional/box2/box2/index.html">open-topped</a>
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.en.origami-club.com/traditional/candybox/candybox/index.html">boxes.</a>
Also, Reggie was a pretty ggod sport about taking some instruction from
me about how to fold up his own balloon made from wrapping paper I
pushed on him.</p>
<p>So far, I'm not that enthused about making little animals. Also, I had
my paper airplane phase as a kid, so that doesn't hold a lot of appeal
for me at the moment. Mostly, pure geometry, as in the balloon-cubes,
and potentially useful knick-knacks, like the candy box, are what I've
been after. With the holidays gone, my interest may fade for a bit.
We'll see.</p>
