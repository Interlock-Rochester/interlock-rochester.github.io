    <p>When we travel, it's&nbsp;common for hackerspace members to reach out to
other hackerspaces located in&nbsp;our destinations. It's a great way to meet
the locals,&nbsp;share ideas, and learn how other&nbsp;people run a hackerspace.
Interlock has entertained guests from&nbsp;all over. Sometimes travelers will
email us saying they are doing a tour of hackerspaces in the region and
wanted to stop in for a night. When we're available, we're happy to
entertain at the space and even take them out for a drink.&nbsp;I remember
one&nbsp;visit from a group travelling first&nbsp;to&nbsp;New York City (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.nycresistor.com/">NYC
Resistor</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.alphaonelabs.com/">Alpha One
Labs</a>), going up through Syracuse (<a class="reference external" href="http://sig315.org/">SIG
315</a>), to Rochester (<a class="reference external" href="#">Interlock</a>) and
ending up in Toronto (<a class="reference external" href="https://hacklab.to/">Hacklab</a>). Our members
have visited spaces all over the country; Florida, Texas, California,
North Carolina, and Washington DC are a few that I can remember. There
is even a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/passport">hackerspace
passport</a> that Noisebridge
started where you can get it stamped at the various hackerspaces that
you visit.</p>

<h2>Hakkavélin<a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2015/01/20141230_205213.jpg"><img alt="20141230_205213" class="size-medium wp-image-1890 alignright" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2015/01/20141230_205213-168x300.jpg" style="width: 168px; height: 300px;" /></a></h2>
<p>Myself and another member recently visited Iceland for New Years for
just over a week and the day after we landed, we jumped on the
<a class="reference external" href="http://hakkavelin.is/">Hakkavélin</a> IRC channel to reach out to see
when open hours were and if we could arrange a visit.&nbsp;While the space
wasn't opened due to the holidays,&nbsp;Sigurður óskarsson&nbsp;was kind enough to
meet us at the hackerspace to take us out to a cafe in town.&nbsp;We talked
shop&nbsp;a bit, discussing projects people were working on and history of
each others' spaces, along with operational details like how they
handled membership and how much they charged.</p>
<p>We learned about their <a class="reference external" href="http://hakkavelin.is/post/74269934436/the-evolutionary-stages-of-the-door-bot">door
system</a>&nbsp;which
consisted of a full computer sitting outside of the space controlling
the door lock. In order to get in, you have to figure out how to use the
console in a hackery way. As I understand it, there's also an IRC bot
which controls this door if you message the right user. Located inside
the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=16/64.1243/-21.9251">University of
Reykjavik</a>,
the group&nbsp;is&nbsp;just outside of the downtown area in South Reykjavik. With
only four hours of light this time of year, I wasn't able to get a good
look at the university but the buildings I saw were pretty with huge
glass walls.</p>
<p>If you have never considered looking up a local hackerspace on your
vacation or business trip, I would strongly recommend you consider it
next time. It's a great way to meet like-minded folk in different
locations.</p>
