    <p>Last night marked the Rochester Hackerspace's first <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Talk">lightning
talk</a> event where we
invited members and friends to come and present on a subject of their
choosing that is less than 5 minutes long. &nbsp;The subjects reflected the
diverse backgrounds of its members; making pcb boards, bump keys, book
binding, boxes, wii bluetooth, and machine guns! We had almost 30 people
crammed into our temporary hackerspace sitting on anything we could
find. &nbsp;Thanks to everyone that made it out and especially those that
took the time to put a talk together.</p>

<p>UPDATE: <a class="reference external" href="http://decausemaker.org/">RemyD</a> was cool enough to offer
his point of view on a first experience visit to Rochester's Hackerspace
and interview a few of us to help spread the word.&nbsp; Check out <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rit.edu/academicaffairs/centerforstudentinnovation/?p=942">RIT's
