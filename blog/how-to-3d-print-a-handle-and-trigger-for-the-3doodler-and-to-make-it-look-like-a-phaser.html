    <p>The<a class="reference external" href="http://the3doodler.com/">3Doodler</a>&nbsp; is a hand-held 3D printer!
The company is now taking orders.&nbsp; Last summer it was a &quot;crowd-funded&quot;
Kickstarter project, and we invested in it.&nbsp; Our reward for sponsoring
this clever invention was to receive our very own pre-production device
in January.&nbsp;It is kind of a cross between a hot-glue gun and a 3D
printer.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2014/03/Doodler-1.png"><img alt="Doodler 1" class="aligncenter wp-image-1635" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2014/03/Doodler-1.png" style="width: 518px; height: 290px;" /></a></p>
<p>Unlike a glue-gun that melts a stick of rubbery plastic to glue things
together, the 3Doodler can melt a 3mm filament of ABS (a kind of plastic
that many things are made of) and extrudes it into a softened web-like
thread that can draw up off of the paper in the open air and into almost
any shape you can imagine.&nbsp; While it is intended&nbsp;to be used for making
plastic objects by drawing 3-dimensional doodles, we use it primarily to
fix plastic objects that have broken or to hack plastic things by adding
features to them.&nbsp; But more about that in a later blog post.</p>
<p>Now we would like to tell you how the team of <strong>MacGyvrBot and Skip</strong>
have found a way to make this great product even better!</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2014/03/Doodler-2.png"><img alt="Doodler 2" class="aligncenter wp-image-1636" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2014/03/Doodler-2.png" style="width: 373px; height: 386px;" /></a></p>
<p>We used Tinkercad to hack-up a model for a Handle and Trigger mechanism,
and then we published the design on
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:267091%20">Thingiverse</a> so that
anyone with access to a 3D printer can download the .stl files and make
a <strong>Phaser Handle for 3Doodler</strong> of their own.</p>
<p>or you can just click these links to download the 3 files</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/download:484759%20%20">Handle</a></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/download:484760%20">Trigger</a></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/download:484761">Plug</a></p>
<p>This kind of sharing is called <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware%20">**open-source hardware
design**</a>&nbsp;and
the practice allows people to build on each other's ideas.&nbsp; You can also
use <a class="reference external" href="https://tinkercad.com/things/6PYe7ez5NDC%20">Tinkercad</a>&nbsp;to copy
this design&nbsp;and modify it with your own ideas.&nbsp; Progress is faster this
way, so open-source design is&nbsp;the best way to get the most out of 3D
printing.</p>
<p><img alt="Doodler 3" class="aligncenter wp-image-1637" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2014/03/Doodler-3.jpg" style="width: 518px; height: 409px;" /></p>
<p>This <strong>Phaser Handle</strong> makes the 3Doodler look cool (like the Star Trek
weapon), but it also makes doodling more comfortable (especially for
people with small hands).&nbsp; The makers of the 3Doodler obviously have
plans for making a handle, because they provided a handy mounting
bracket with threaded holes for M3 screws.&nbsp; But we couldnâ€™t wait!</p>
<p>The handle alone is beneficial, but using the trigger with the handle
keeps the hand more relaxed during extended doodling.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2014/03/Doodler-4.jpg"><img alt="Doodler 4" class="aligncenter wp-image-1638" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2014/03/Doodler-4.jpg" style="width: 518px; height: 419px;" /></a></p>
<p>The Phaser Handle is attached to the 3Doodler with a pair of M3 x 10mm
screws (any head design).&nbsp; The trigger attaches to the handle with a
pair of small flat head screws (such as 6-32 x 3/8 inch or M3 x 6mm)
serving as hinge pins.&nbsp; The screws are available at Lowes and Home
Depot.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2014/03/Doodler-5.jpg"><img alt="Doodler 5" class="aligncenter wp-image-1639" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2014/03/Doodler-5.jpg" style="width: 518px; height: 383px;" /></a></p>
<p>The handle is hollow to allow access to a mounting screw (rather than
having an infill of plastic in a sparse honeycomb pattern).&nbsp; If your
printer drops a few threads while bridging across the top of the handle,
just let it finish the job.&nbsp; Chances are it will recover before the top
layer is reached.&nbsp; If it fails, you may have to adjust your slicer
settings (such as slowing the speed for bridges) and try again.</p>
<p>In our next blog post, we will show you how to use the 3Doodler itself
to update the Phaser Handle. &nbsp; The exercise will be a good demonstration
of using the 3Doodler to hack an existing product.</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>
