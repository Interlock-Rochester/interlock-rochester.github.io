    <p>A few years ago, I put in an order at Sparkfun, which included 8 1-Watt
Luxeon LEDs. &nbsp;My original thought was that I would rebuild an lightshow
device that I had built many years ago, but instead of it driving 110V
spot lights through solid state relays, it would instead be more
self-contained, and use high power LEDs instead. &nbsp;This project never
happened, since I never figured out how to power the LEDs properly.</p>
<p>I've recently been getting into doing more little projects, especially
since I want to have <em>something</em> to do on Tuesday nights at Interlock.
&nbsp;I saw the box of these things on the shelf, and decided to try driving
them directly from an Arduino. &nbsp; I know that I could have used one of
the BlinkM modules, or the strand of RGB Pixels or whatever for this,
but I had these, and I wanted to see what I could do / how bright I
could make them without frying the Arduino.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/09/2012-09-26-09.10.10-e1348677126508.jpg"><img alt="image0" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-994" src="/wp-uploads/2012/09/2012-09-26-09.10.10-e1348677126508-300x271.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 271px;" /></a></p>
<p>The project I decided to work on with them is to make a single
high-brightness RGB pixel, and drive it from a Processing sketch on my
computer. &nbsp;Eventually, the thought might be to sample a TV's color,
30fps for a few hours, then just store those brightness/color levels.
&nbsp;Then, play them back on the pixel to light a room. &nbsp;From outside of the
room, it <em>should</em> look like a television is on, showing some kind of TV
show. &nbsp;The way I went with testing this was to take a movie trailer, and
crunch it down to a few pixels, and then average the colors in it while
it plays back, live via Processing, then send the RGB values over
USB-Serial to be displayed on the pixel.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/09/2012-09-26-09.13.51.jpg"><img alt="image1" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-997" src="/wp-uploads/2012/09/2012-09-26-09.13.51-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /></a></p>
<p>I started out by soldering up a Red, Green, and Blue LED to a small
piece of perf board. &nbsp;I tied them together for a common ground on one
side, and through a 220 ohm resistor on the other side, and all of this
out to the Arduino. &nbsp;I use PWM pins on the Arduino to adjust their
brightness, since that's simple to do.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/09/2012-09-26-09.11.51.jpg"><img alt="image2" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-995" src="/wp-uploads/2012/09/2012-09-26-09.11.51-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /></a></p>
<p>The Processing sketch sends down 0..255 for red, green, and blue
intensities, then those values are plugged directly into the PWM pins
via AnalogWrite() calls, which displays a reasonable facsimile of the
color requested.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/09/2012-09-26-09.12.31.jpg"><img alt="image3" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-996" src="/wp-uploads/2012/09/2012-09-26-09.12.31-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /></a></p>
<p>The project worked out pretty darn well. &nbsp;Without current drivers for
the LEDs, I can't make them too bright, but in an hour of sitting down
at Interlock, I had this working. &nbsp;I wrote up two processing sketches.
&nbsp;One with a RGB color wheel - click to send that color to the LEDs, and
another playing the video as described above. &nbsp;(Arduino and Processing
sketches available upon request. :D )</p>
