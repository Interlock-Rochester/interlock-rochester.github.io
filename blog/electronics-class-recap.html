    <p>In addition to being our weekly open night, last Tuesday was the first
of five classes providing an introduction to electronic components,
circuits, and methods. Attendance was great, and gratitude goes to our
intrepid instructor, Carl, who did an excellent job of explaining these
concepts for the layperson.</p>

<p>Interlock would also like to extend a special thanks, from the bottom of
our stomachs, to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.camspizzeria.com/">Cam's Pizzeria</a> for
providing free pizza to visitors and attendees of last week's class.</p>

<h2>Missed The Class?</h2>
<p>If you would like to take this course but were unable to attend the
first class, fret not! You can catch up by reading the <a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2010/10/basic-electronics-class-1.pdf">lecture
notes</a>,
and there will be plenty of knowledgeable individuals to answer
questions after the class or during the course labs on Thursday nights.</p>
<p>The course continues this Tuesday, October 19th at 8:00PM, and will go
into further detail about how each component works and how they function
within a circuit.</p>
