    <p>We've held the second of <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/#!/interlockroc/statuses/200546366982848512">our monthly 3D printing
meetings</a>
recently, with a fifth person getting trained up on how to use our
current printer, and are on the cusp of another advancement in our
<a class="reference external" href="{filename}/quick-open-house-recap.rst">previously-mentioned 3D printing
capabilities</a>,
now that 3 people have decided which printer design they're going to
build next.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we continue to torture Beardicus's poor little <a class="reference external" href="http://reprappro.com/Huxley">Huxley
RepRapPro</a> making other little
tschotskes that speak to our interests. This doesn't get us closer to
the glorious future of 3D printers for everyone, but I like to think of
it as our answer to Wall Street's &quot;profit taking&quot;: Every once in a while
it's nice to just cash out a little bit and enjoy what you've already
got.</p>
<p>My turn at that most recently was this little model of monomeric
insulin, based on the crystal structure reported by <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1504238">Gursky et.
al.</a></p>
<p>The trick is how to take a computer model of something like this:</p>
<p><img alt="9ins solvent-accessible surface Z rotation" src="http://deejoe.etrumeus.com/interlock/9ins/9ins.gif" /></p>
<p>and print it on the 3D printer so that it goes from being an
on-the-screen abstraction to something you can hold.</p>
<p>Consider that there are many different ways to render these things on a
screen:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/05/montage2.png"><img alt="image1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-928" src="/wp-uploads/2012/05/montage2.png" style="width: 576px; height: 567px;" /></a></p>
<p>Each has its uses. But learning how to manipulate an on-screen rendering
can be a fraught experience. How much better, then, to have the option
of turning the model over directly, with your own hands?</p>
<p>With fused deposition printing, the problem is that the irregular
surface doesn't really present a good way of getting the nascent object
to stick to the print bed.</p>
<p>To start, I trolled through the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rcsb.org">RCSB</a> web site
for a suitable small globular protein that had a bit of name
recognition. I picked
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin">insulin</a>, and from among the
various insulin entries, picked
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=9ins">9INS</a>.</p>
<p>I brought that file up in <a class="reference external" href="http://pymol.org">PyMOL</a>, issued &quot;hide
everything&quot; and then &quot;show surface&quot; (or their GUI equivalents) and, with
a few other visual tweaks, like setting the color, exported a VRML 2
(.wrl) file. I played around with that in meshlab a bit, exporting it
then as an .stl file.</p>
<p>I finally sorted out that what I really needed to do was bring it into
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.blender.org">Blender</a> and subtract a cube-shaped (well,
any volume with a flat face would probably do) volume from the molecule
to give a partial rendering of the model with a flat surface. Doing that
twice, to generate each &quot;half&quot; of the molecule, leaves me with two .stl
files that can be printed flat side down. In some cases, I've brought
the file into <a class="reference external" href="http://cloud.netfabb.com">netfabb's online service</a>
for cleanup of manifold errors. Then, I bring each file into
<a class="reference external" href="http://replicat.org">ReplicatorG</a> to more easily scale and orient
the model. Finally, I bring the .stl files into
<a class="reference external" href="http://slic3r.org">Slic3r</a> to generate the .g file for taking over
to the printer.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/05/IMG_4786.jpg"><img alt="image2" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-889" src="/wp-uploads/2012/05/IMG_4786-300x225.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 225px;" /></a></p>
<p>This result is a fairly small protein and a fairly small model that was
fast to design and print as a proof of concept. Future challenges will
be to find ways of dividing up larger models and of larger molecules or
multi-molecule assemblies so they can be printed, perhaps printing
different chains in different colors, preserving relative scaling
between different components and the like.</p>
