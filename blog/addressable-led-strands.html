<p>I'm in the process of constructing/setting up my office in the house,
and for lighting, I have decided that I want to use xmas light-style
lighting. &nbsp;Many years ago, I used to light my room with
multicolored&nbsp;incandescent&nbsp;lights. I loved the warm indirect glow, and
smooth light without a single light source. &nbsp;This time, I'm going to
take it a step further.</p>
<p>While there's nothing about this project yet that is really innovative
over what others have done, it is the first step to getting the office
lighting done. &nbsp;The real fun will come into play once I'm able to hang
this up, and start programming effects, and tying those effects in to
physical or time-based events.</p>
<p>A couple years back I picked up a strand of addressable LED lights,
similar to&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://adafruit.com/products/322">this one, available at
adafruit.com</a>. &nbsp;I got a strand of
50 lights, blew out one of them while being stupid, and used a few of
them in Jasper's Toy Box (posts to come about that eventually), so I'm
left with 42 lights. &nbsp;A nice number.</p>
<p>In any event, the plan is to hang them up around the upper perimeter of
the room, and it will give a nice comfortable glow to illuminate the
room. &nbsp;I can also extend it by doing lighting effects with the color.
&nbsp;For example, in the evening I can have all of them dim blue, and
randomly twinkle one to white, to simulate a star in the sky. &nbsp;I could
also tie them in to an automation system to glow a particular corner of
the room red or yellow when i have email from a specific person. &nbsp;I
could also adjust their color based on the content of my monitor, or the
light outisde, etc.</p>
<p>The basic design for the control circuitry is that there will be
an&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://arduino.cc/">Arduino-based</a>&nbsp;AVR micro (actually&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://geodesicsphere.blogspot.com/2012/11/reverse-engineering-stepper-motor_5.html">one of
the D-15 servo controllers I've
appropriated</a>),
which is perfect, since the strands only need two lines to control them.
&nbsp;The host computer will send down codes to address the LEDs (set all to
color X, set led Y to color X, etc) and this will pass on the content to
the strand, and twiddle the data lines and all of that fun stuff. &nbsp;I had
considered putting more &quot;smarts&quot; into the micro, but the amount of space
in there would severely limit the kind of content I could &quot;display&quot;, so
I decided to put all of the grunt work back on the host computer.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uM2j8G4bmkI/UQAByR5gu9I/AAAAAAAACMs/VDXCsItz4Y8/s1600/2013-01-22+20.57.51.jpg"><img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uM2j8G4bmkI/UQAByR5gu9I/AAAAAAAACMs/VDXCsItz4Y8/s640/2013-01-22+20.57.51.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /></a></p>
<p>To power it, I needed to get a 5 volt power supply. I snagged a power
brick from an old external drive case, as well as a standard PC power
connector, from a failed power supply, and spliced the two of them
together.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0Lk4XPmclbQ/UQAB5hIWmkI/AAAAAAAACM0/kjh75lnZnPI/s1600/2013-01-22+21.08.04.jpg"><img alt="image2" class="aligncenter" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0Lk4XPmclbQ/UQAB5hIWmkI/AAAAAAAACM0/kjh75lnZnPI/s640/2013-01-22+21.08.04.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 454px;" /></a></p>
<p>Copious, yet appropriate amounts of heat shrink tubing and splicing some
wires yielded a nice power supply.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qRuJm5PwJS8/UQACEt5W8LI/AAAAAAAACM8/DRBHdWGILGk/s1600/2013-01-22+22.17.59.jpg"><img alt="image3" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qRuJm5PwJS8/UQACEt5W8LI/AAAAAAAACM8/DRBHdWGILGk/s640/2013-01-22+22.17.59.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /></a></p>
<p>Next, I built an interface board to tie it all together. &nbsp;The ports on
the board are (left to right) - 6 pin FTDI interface for serial IO, 2
pin jumper (power the D15 from the power supply rather than FTDI
source), 3 pin power, 4 pin light strand connector. &nbsp;You can also see in
this picture, the process of crimping the terminals for the molex
connector on the LED strand's wires.</p>
<p>I kept the layout and pinout of the FTDI the same as I used for&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://geodesicsphere.blogspot.com/2012/12/prototype-elias-serial-network-node.html">my
serial node
experiment</a>.
&nbsp;This will help me plug that connector in correctly. &nbsp;I&nbsp;still&nbsp;need to
add visual cues (colored sharpie markings) to help me align the pins
correctly. &nbsp;The power connector has GND on pins 1 and 3, and +5V on pin
2. &nbsp;Keeping it symmetrical will help me always plug it in correctly,
reducing the chance that I will blow it all up. &nbsp;The 4 pin connector is
the same pinout as the wiring of the LEDs. &nbsp;GND, Data, Clock, +5.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sn6v9P3L0Ck/UQDMlTmqFZI/AAAAAAAACOk/auhjvIBC_9w/s1600/2013-01-24+00.12.35.jpg"><img alt="image4" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sn6v9P3L0Ck/UQDMlTmqFZI/AAAAAAAACOk/auhjvIBC_9w/s640/2013-01-24+00.12.35.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /></a></p>
<p>The jumper on the board (dis)connects the power header from the D15 and
FTDI portion. &nbsp;If I make standalone firmware for it, I can power
everything from the power supply, if need be. The tiny green LED on the
board just lights when the D15 has power. &nbsp;A nice indicator in case
everything else is not functioning.</p>
<p>The protocol I used for this is very simple. &nbsp;There's a command
character sent through serial, then the data for that command. &nbsp;If the
firmware is expecting a command character but gets something it doesn't
understand, it just keeps checking the serial input for a command it
knows. &nbsp;The protocol is as follows:</p>
<div><p><strong>p&lt;index of LED&gt;&lt;red value&gt;&lt;green value&gt;&lt;blue value&gt;</strong></p>
</div><p>Five bytes. &nbsp;It sets the specified LED (0..42 in this case) with the
specified RGB value (0..255 each). &nbsp;Note that this is not an ascii
string, it is data. &nbsp;So no matter what, it is 5 bytes to change a single
pixel.</p>
<div><p><strong>f&lt;red value&gt;&lt;green value&gt;&lt;blue value&gt;</strong></p>
</div><div><p>Force all of the lights to the specified color. &nbsp;This is handy for
clearing everything to black, or flashing/fading effects.</p>
</div><div><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/BleuLlama/GeodesicSphere/tree/master/Projects/AddressableLEDStrip">Here's the Arduino firmware used to handle all of
this</a>:
&nbsp;(Note: it requires that the strand's library be installed.)</p>

</div><div><p>For now, that's it. &nbsp;I made<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/BleuLlama/GeodesicSphere/tree/master/Projects/AddressableLEDStrip">a simple interface on the desktop side in

<div><p>Eventually, I will write better desktop software which will use the LEDs
for indication of events, as well as f.lux style color effects
throughout the day, audio/visual synchronization to media being played,
and other effects as well as time goes on</p>
