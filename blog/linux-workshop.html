<p>At the January Linux Workshop several people needed their systems
updated. New versions of Linux Mint and SUSE were loaded. Experiments
were done with other distros so each machine had multiple systems loaded
. So a lot of discussing current events in the Linux world while we
waited for installs to finish.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/01/2012-01-21_14-02-07_504.jpg"><img alt="image1" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-784" src="/wp-uploads/2012/01/2012-01-21_14-02-07_504-300x168.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 168px;" /></a></p>
<p>The other project was to figure out how to downgrade FireFox on Ubuntu.
FireFox 9 broke a plugin but there appears to be no way to downgrade
back to FireFox 8 on Ubuntu. Apparently all the older versions of
FireFox have been removed from the repositories. The older version can
be downloaded and installed manually but the requirement is for a simple
maintainable way to install so old laptops can be supplied to kids with
the kid friendly FireFox plugin. The plugin is just a version of a
Windows app that uses IE so now the challenge will be to see if that app
will run in wine. Maybe we'll have an answer by next month.</p>
