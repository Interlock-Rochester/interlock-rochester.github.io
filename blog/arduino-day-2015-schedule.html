<p>We're still working through exactly what will be presented on Saturday
for Arduino Day, but here's a rough idea... We can always adjust content
based on the attending audience... And if more people show up in the
afternoon or evening, we can always run through things again. We're
going to play this a lot by-ear.</p>
<p><strong>*`More about Arduino Day can be found
here... &lt;http://day.arduino.cc&gt;`__*</strong></p>
<p>We will be running an Arduino project challenge contest! Using an
Arduino (or related micro), along with any resources and tools in the
Interlock space, and/or materials you bring yourself,&nbsp;what cool thing
can you build? &nbsp;Some old hardware (printers, scanners, misc parts) will
be available to take apart... Judging will happen at 9:30, points will
be awarded for usefulness, niftiness, artistic quality, and technical
depth... &nbsp; The winner(s) will get something, to be determined. ;)</p>
<p>Throughout the day, we'll have the doors open for all who want to visit
and participate, or just check us and our space out. We'll be around all
day to help you with your Arduino project, or get help from you on our
projects! ;)</p>
