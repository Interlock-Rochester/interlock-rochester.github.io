  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Last week, I drove a car full of Interlocutors down to Lima, NY to visit
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.smidgensinc.com/">Smidgens, Inc.</a>, our friendly local
laser manufactory. I wanted to get some parts cut out of half-inch
plywood for the <a class="reference external" href="http://makeyourbot.wikidot.com/mantis9-1">Mantis 9.1 CNC
mill</a> we're building.
Although the parts are designed to be easily cut by hand, I really
wanted an excuse to see some big-ass lasers and to make the acquaintance
of those in charge of said equipment. So off we went. Keep scrolling for
pictures and some commentary.</p>

<p>Gary – the co-owner of Smidgens, along with his wife Rita – gave us
quite an extensive tour, and answered all of our pesky questions while
we gawked at the machinery. Above, you can see one of their lasers
cutting crane parts out of quarter-inch steel. I was pretty surprised
how quiet the whole operation was, given the amount of cutting going on.
Most of the noise was from the ventilation systems that were constantly
huffing smoke out to the great outdoors.</p>

<p>Sorry for the butt-shot, but here's an overall view of the main space.
There's one more marking laser in another room off to the right, and the
metal-cutting laser is to your left. They also have a bit of storage in
the corner for commonly used materials.</p>

<p>They had three lasers like the above, and these mostly do wood and
acrylic cutting and etching. I failed to shoot the 8-ish foot long laser
tube, the massive power supply, and the ridiculously beefy stepper
(servo?) motors driving the XY tables. So sorry. It really made the
nerds go all giggity.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/5333840359/"><img alt="Marilyn Toast" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5041/5333840359_742bd8ed24.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 333px;" /></a></p>
<p>Bread. Dried, lasered, lacquered. It's a miracle! Rita does some fun
stuff with the lasers that I'm sure their engineers hadn't anticipated.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/5334435084/"><img alt="Marking Machine" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5010/5334435084_1e22090647.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 333px;" /></a></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/5334439258/"><img alt="Interlock tours Smidgens 5" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5089/5334439258_34fee5de7d.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 333px;" /></a></p>
<p>This machine was solely for cutting thin materials or marking things at
an insane speed. Instead of moving the entire workpiece or optics in an
XY fashion, it has two mirrors that remain stationary and just twiddle
the beam to and fro. The design you see above took about ten or fifteen
seconds to cut.</p>

<p>And here are the parts! Time for assembly... soon enough we'll be
milling circuit boards in-house at Interlock. Thanks again, Gary, for
cutting our parts and taking the time to show us your lasers!</p>
