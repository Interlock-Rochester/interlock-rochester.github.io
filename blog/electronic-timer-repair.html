    <p>Our kitchen timer has been acting up recently, and with Thanksgiving
quickly approaching, I needed to do something about it. &nbsp;The push button
for the start/stop function has been getting harder and harder to use.
&nbsp;In the past, I've cracked it open and cleaned out the pad underneath
the rubberized button membrane, but this time, doing this didn't work. I
also &nbsp;wanted a more permanent fix.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-W2RX7bp_FDQ/ULTZfXs02OI/AAAAAAAAB-k/J9ZA4wveUHw/s1600/l_6x6x9mm-tactile-push-button-switch-momentary-x200-a97d.JPG"><img alt="image0" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-W2RX7bp_FDQ/ULTZfXs02OI/AAAAAAAAB-k/J9ZA4wveUHw/s320/l_6x6x9mm-tactile-push-button-switch-momentary-x200-a97d.JPG" style="width: 320px; height: 320px;" /></a></p>
<p>I decided to replace the membrane switch for that function with one of
these tactile buttons. &nbsp;I just had to make sure that the solder pads
would line up. &nbsp;I worked out an orientation in which the solder pads
would match the pushbutton pads, as you can see in the next image.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5CeberbMixw/ULTZM7UihAI/AAAAAAAAB-I/wLUai6clHPo/s1600/2012-11-20+22.05.48.jpg"><img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5CeberbMixw/ULTZM7UihAI/AAAAAAAAB-I/wLUai6clHPo/s400/2012-11-20+22.05.48.jpg" style="width: 298px; height: 400px;" /></a></p>
<p>The only issue is that rather than the rubber membrane sitting flush
with the board, it now had to&nbsp;accommodate&nbsp;the shape and size of the
switch along with the button which extended out quite far. &nbsp;I used a
pair of diagonal cutters to nip away at the rubber from behind to recess
the switch into the button itself, Ben Heck style.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EEh7ZDp8H7o/ULTZNu0snjI/AAAAAAAAB-Q/1oGXGXTRpho/s1600/2012-11-20+22.08.16.jpg"><img alt="image2" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EEh7ZDp8H7o/ULTZNu0snjI/AAAAAAAAB-Q/1oGXGXTRpho/s400/2012-11-20+22.08.16.jpg" style="width: 298px; height: 400px;" /></a></p>
<p>You can see this in the top right of the gray membrane. &nbsp;The two contact
pads have been removed, and instead there is the hole, into which the
switch recesses. &nbsp;The hole was made fairly crudely, but it works!</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hS3feisTxMk/ULTZOc3WfZI/AAAAAAAAB-Y/-IID8imYNqI/s1600/2012-11-20+22.17.39.jpg"><img alt="image3" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hS3feisTxMk/ULTZOc3WfZI/AAAAAAAAB-Y/-IID8imYNqI/s320/2012-11-20+22.17.39.jpg" style="width: 239px; height: 320px;" /></a></p>
<p>It's been accidentally abused over the years, and as a result, the
screws on the bottom no longer hold it together as the plastic has
broken enough. &nbsp;The strip of electrical tape around the base does well
to hold it together while still looking super stylish! NOTE: It's not
actually very stylish, but rather, functional and should last for many
years more to come. &nbsp;No reason to throw it out, when an hour or so of
work will get it fully functional again!</p>
