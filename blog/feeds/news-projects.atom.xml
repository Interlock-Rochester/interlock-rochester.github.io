the information needed to take action, such as to-do checklists, photos,
links to documentation, etc. &amp;nbsp;The state of the card is indicated by the
name of its list (&amp;quot;Ideas&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Active&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Need Help&amp;quot;, etc). &amp;nbsp;The &amp;quot;goal&amp;quot; is
for the cards&amp;nbsp;to move from left to right as ideas&amp;nbsp;progress from vague
concepts to completed projects.&lt;/p&gt;

glance: here's some of our ideas and active projects.[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important for all of us to know what projects are underway at
Interlock. &amp;nbsp;Many of us have particular
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4ttVP2cyK4"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;or
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vxjunkies"&gt;equipment&lt;/a&gt; that could help a
project move along, or we might simply be interested in learning more by
collaborating. &amp;nbsp;While it's great to get together and talk about plans in
person each month, it's impossible to get all of us together at the same
time with any regularity, and sometimes inspiration hits at weird times.
&amp;nbsp;Having an easy mechanism to jot down ideas, track the progress of
projects, and collaborate with others is helping us be more effective
and creative already, and the detailed records of a project evolving
should&amp;nbsp;help us
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://trello.com/c/wMeVgm6Y/49-trello-blog-post"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;with more
regularly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please feel free to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://trello.com/b/dsfhrqxR/projects"&gt;browse&amp;nbsp;our public projects
board&lt;/a&gt; to see what we're up
to between our monthly meetings. &amp;nbsp;If you're an Interlock member and
would like access, create a Trello account and then let Joe or another
board member know your username.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you've ever considered donating to Interlock, but didn't like the
fact that we were only a New York State non-profit organization, well
now you can rejoice&amp;nbsp;as our Federal 501c3 status as a non-profit
organization has been approved. Last night we celebrated our new&amp;nbsp;Federal

fact that we were only a New York State non-profit organization, well
now you can rejoice&amp;nbsp;as our Federal 501c3 status as a non-profit
organization has been approved. Last night we celebrated our new&amp;nbsp;Federal
status and discussed some of the potential options we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-this-means"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What this means&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this doesn't change a lot from a day-to-day basis, it does mean
that if someone was interested in donating to the space to get a tax
write-off, we are able to give you a voucher for you to use in your
taxes. Some ideas for donations include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cash donations to help pay our rent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Materials donation that go towards a specific project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computer equipment donations (within the last 4 years)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3D printers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Various other gadgets that you think we could use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll soon be stream lining our donation process&amp;nbsp;but in the mean time,
you can email your donation questions to info at interlockroc.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="changes-to-dues"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Changes to Dues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we progress, we will also be making changes to the way that we
collect dues. While we cannot say that&amp;nbsp;membership dues are a tax write
off, we can adjust our dues so that a portion is for membership, and a
portion is a donation for the write off. If this confuses you, don't
worry, we'll take care of the hard work for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="next-steps"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're still in the process of updating our&amp;nbsp;system for accepting
donations, changing how dues are accepted,&amp;nbsp;and working on taking
advantage of our status, but in the mean time if you have any questions,
you can email info at interlockroc.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
