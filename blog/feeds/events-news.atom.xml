Source Software (F/OSS) and technology and when we heard that Fedora was
planning their annual con, Flock To Fedora, here in Rochester, we were
pretty excited. There are a ton different talks in various categories
including Linux desktop, infrastructure, security, kernel, and hardware.
Check out the schedule here:&lt;/p&gt;

space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our new president,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/yorgle"&gt;Scott
Lawrence&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;brings his background in
electronics, software development, antique computer hardware, electronic
reverse engineering, and Legos to the position. Carl Schmidtmann will
complete a second term as Vice President providing his knowledge of
numerous subjects&amp;nbsp;including&amp;nbsp;super computers, Linux, electronics and all
kinds of subjects. A relatively new member, Joe Hale is welcomed in as
our Secretary. &amp;nbsp;Bill Horst-Kotter will be representing the &amp;quot;Member at
Large&amp;quot; position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are especially excited about our new treasurer, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/hoopycat"&gt;Ryan
Tucker&lt;/a&gt;, as he has been investing time
into &amp;nbsp;improving our financial situation, helping to make&amp;nbsp;it easier&amp;nbsp;to
take in donations as a newly 501c3, and making sure that money is being
spent wisely. As a member, Ryan&amp;nbsp;will continue to leak out his knowledge
related to&amp;nbsp;RF, software-defined radios, software development,
electronics,&amp;nbsp;networking, and all kinds of interesting subjects we have
yet to discover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to&amp;nbsp;the next generation of Interlock Rochester's board of
directors.&lt;/p&gt;

of the formation of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://rochesterbrainery.com/"&gt;the Rochester
Brainery&lt;/a&gt;, opening early next month in
the Village Gate, across the Goodman Street railyard from us here at
Interlock and our neighbors at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://thehungerford.com/"&gt;the
Hungerford&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Smokestack Coworking logo" src="/wp-uploads/2013/02/smokestackcowork.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll always owe a debt to Dave at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.coworkingrochester.com/"&gt;Coworking
Rochester&lt;/a&gt; for helping us get
started by offering space and moral support during some of our bigger
early organizational meetings, before we settled on a space of our own
to rent. Still, it's interesting to see people coming together in
another coworking space in town, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://smokestackcowork.com/"&gt;Smokestack
Coworking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://rocwiki.org/High_Falls"&gt;High
Falls&lt;/a&gt; area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's hoping they both thrive and complement each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Ithaca Generator logo" src="/wp-uploads/2013/02/robotic-logo-like2.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month we received a visitor from Ithaca, José, who traveled up with
a couple of friends maybe to join what he thought at the time was the
closest hackerspace to him. I had a great time talking with him, so it
was a little bittersweet to tell him &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ithacagenerator.org/"&gt;Ithaca
Generator&lt;/a&gt; has recently gotten off to
what looks like a good start and might just meet his needs without the
long drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I wasn't able to make it to their &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ithacagenerator.org/events/open-house/"&gt;open
house&lt;/a&gt; back in
December. But, I&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;did visit with some family over the holidays who were able to go and
got to see the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.evilmadscientist.com/2008/edge-lit-holiday-cards/"&gt;party
favors&lt;/a&gt;
they made at the open house. Fun. Look like good things are in store
for the hands-on, DIY hacker and maker community in Ithaca.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Buffalo Labs logo" src="/wp-uploads/2013/02/buffalo-lab.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also been having a friend, Joe, make the trip from Niagara Falls
every so often to visit, which has had us asking how things are going at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.buffalolab.org/blog/"&gt;Buffalo Lab&lt;/a&gt;. Figured we've give
them a shout out while we're at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[placehold for eventual &lt;strong&gt;Rochester Makerspace&lt;/strong&gt; logo]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, but hopefully not least, the most recent big news is a
much-anticipated step for the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rochestermakerspace.org/"&gt;group&lt;/a&gt; calling themselves
Rochester Makerspace. They've rented a space a little north of downtown,
on St. Paul Street. Just Tuesday they had &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rochestermakerspace.org/tuesday-meeting-reminder-pizza-0205/"&gt;a get-together with
pizza&lt;/a&gt;
at the new location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the planning for this new space has been careful and deliberate,
ongoing since at least this last summer, they now are moving towards
ambitious goals to grow fast. I continue eagerly to await the opening of
another maker-friendly space in Rochester, expected some time in March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello hackers. Look at your office. Now look at the hackerspace. Now
back at your office. Now back to the space. Sadly, your office doesn't
look like the hacker space. Do you know what the new hackerspace looks
like? No? Well now's your opportunity. I'm on a horse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, Friday 3/16, at 7pm we are throwing an open house at the
space. Of course it's free, we just want to show off our new digs. It's
probably a perfect time for you to visit if you've never been. Or if
you've only seen the old tiny space, see what we have to offer now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just so we can figure out how many people are coming, click on this link
to get a ticket:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's what to expect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="food"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hacking makes you hungry. As a reward for stopping by on a Friday night,
we'll be feeding you. Members are bringing in food in a pot-luck style.
Mostly things to nibble at so bring an appetite. Eating and hacking;
does it get better? Well... yeah but it's still pretty cool right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="mini-presentations"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mini-Presentations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common question that we get. &amp;quot;What are you working on?&amp;quot; To try
and answer that, we've created mini presentations about what people do
at the space. Here's what we have so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amateur radio workshop run by JustBill and Walter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction to lockpicking run by Antitree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3D printer presentation and possible demo by Berticus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basics of electronics run by RoboAlex&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bicycle repair run by BinaryMan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="hackerspace-tour"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hackerspace Tour&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Here are some things to check out while you're at the space:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rooms: Meeting room, hang out room, table hackers room, workshop
area, Ham shack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pen plotters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3D printers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metal lathe and wood working tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ham radio shack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Electronics workbench&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
