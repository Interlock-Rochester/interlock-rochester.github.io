our first How Do I (HDI) related to security -- Burp Suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burp Suite is an HTTP/HTTPS proxy tool that can help you better
understand how a web application works. Designed for security, it
allows anyone to man-in-the-middle(MITM) web traffic, learn how a
web application works, and manipulate the traffic to see how the
application responds. Uses include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- debugging your web application to find why it doesn't work&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- identifying and exploiting security vulnerabilities&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- using it to inspect mobile traffic&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- answering the question ... &amp;quot;I wonder how that works&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seminar will start with a basic presentation about the Burp
Suite tools which is provided free to download.[0] The class will
walk through identifying vulnerabilities in a demo web site. All
attendees are expected to bring a laptop (Linux, OSX, or Windows) or
coordinate borrowing one before the workshop. If you have the ram to
support it, it's also recommended you run Vmware Player /
Workstation / Fusion on your system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're interested, please RSVP on the meetup site below. As always,
the workshop is open to the public for free. Please consider dropping a
few dollars in the donation bucket.&lt;/p&gt;

Interlock has entertained guests from&amp;nbsp;all over. Sometimes travelers will
email us saying they are doing a tour of hackerspaces in the region and
wanted to stop in for a night. When we're available, we're happy to
entertain at the space and even take them out for a drink.&amp;nbsp;I remember
one&amp;nbsp;visit from a group travelling first&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;New York City (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.nycresistor.com/"&gt;NYC
Resistor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.alphaonelabs.com/"&gt;Alpha One
Labs&lt;/a&gt;), going up through Syracuse (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sig315.org/"&gt;SIG
315&lt;/a&gt;), to Rochester (&lt;a class="reference external" href="#"&gt;Interlock&lt;/a&gt;) and
ending up in Toronto (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://hacklab.to/"&gt;Hacklab&lt;/a&gt;). Our members
have visited spaces all over the country; Florida, Texas, California,
North Carolina, and Washington DC are a few that I can remember. There
is even a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/passport"&gt;hackerspace
passport&lt;/a&gt; that Noisebridge
started where you can get it stamped at the various hackerspaces that
you visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="hakkavelin20141230-205213"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hakkavélin&lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2015/01/20141230_205213.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="20141230_205213" class="size-medium wp-image-1890 alignright" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2015/01/20141230_205213-168x300.jpg" style="width: 168px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myself and another member recently visited Iceland for New Years for
just over a week and the day after we landed, we jumped on the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hakkavelin.is/"&gt;Hakkavélin&lt;/a&gt; IRC channel to reach out to see
when open hours were and if we could arrange a visit.&amp;nbsp;While the space
wasn't opened due to the holidays,&amp;nbsp;Sigurður óskarsson&amp;nbsp;was kind enough to
meet us at the hackerspace to take us out to a cafe in town.&amp;nbsp;We talked
shop&amp;nbsp;a bit, discussing projects people were working on and history of
each others' spaces, along with operational details like how they
handled membership and how much they charged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned about their &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hakkavelin.is/post/74269934436/the-evolutionary-stages-of-the-door-bot"&gt;door
system&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;which
consisted of a full computer sitting outside of the space controlling
the door lock. In order to get in, you have to figure out how to use the
console in a hackery way. As I understand it, there's also an IRC bot
which controls this door if you message the right user. Located inside
the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=16/64.1243/-21.9251"&gt;University of
Reykjavik&lt;/a&gt;,
the group&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;just outside of the downtown area in South Reykjavik. With
only four hours of light this time of year, I wasn't able to get a good
look at the university but the buildings I saw were pretty with huge
glass walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have never considered looking up a local hackerspace on your
vacation or business trip, I would strongly recommend you consider it
next time. It's a great way to meet like-minded folk in different
locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

into &amp;nbsp;improving our financial situation, helping to make&amp;nbsp;it easier&amp;nbsp;to

spent wisely. As a member, Ryan&amp;nbsp;will continue to leak out his knowledge
related to&amp;nbsp;RF, software-defined radios, software development,

&lt;h2&gt;About Girl Develop It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Girl Develop It is a nonprofit organization that was launched in New
York in 2010. The initial goal was to draw more women to the development
community and to provide judgment-free learning opportunities through
teaching one another. Girl Develop It has since grown within the vision
of creating a network of empowered women who feel confident in their
abilities to code and build beautiful web and mobile applications. The
organization is currently making an impact in 33 cities around the US
and Canada with 10 new chapters, including Rochester.&lt;/p&gt;

you can email your donation questions to info at interlockroc.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="changes-to-dues"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Changes to Dues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we progress, we will also be making changes to the way that we
collect dues. While we cannot say that&amp;nbsp;membership dues are a tax write
off, we can adjust our dues so that a portion is for membership, and a
portion is a donation for the write off. If this confuses you, don't
worry, we'll take care of the hard work for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="next-steps"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're still in the process of updating our&amp;nbsp;system for accepting
donations, changing how dues are accepted,&amp;nbsp;and working on taking
advantage of our status, but in the mean time if you have any questions,
you can email info at interlockroc.org.&lt;/p&gt;

annual meeting. Normally this is a time for everyone to hang out, eat,
drink, and give presentations. Previous years, I give my personal
presentation about things I wanted to do, things I failed at, things I
succeeded, and things I'll be attempting the coming year. We invited
everyone this year to give a similar style presentation and the results
were pretty interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="our-past"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Past&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick review of where we're at. The organization started in
September-ish of 2009, where we met in coffee shops around Rochester, to
try and come up with whether or not we should make a hackerspace in the
area. We came to the conclusion that we wanted to do everything from the
ground up, receiving no outside financial help. At the time, we were
pretty adamant about not having it called a &amp;quot;Makerspace&amp;quot; because the
membership had a much wider range of interests than just making
(software development, hardware reverse engineering, network security,
radio, art, etc). So our bylaws stated that we will create a space
focused on the interests of the members at that time. This gave us a lot
of flexibility to interpret what the space would be used for. We
received our &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://appext20.dos.ny.gov/corp_public/CORPSEARCH.ENTITY_INFORMATION?p_nameid=3901177&amp;amp;p_corpid=3894341&amp;amp;p_entity_name=Interlock%20Rochester&amp;amp;p_name_type=A&amp;amp;p_search_type=BEGINS&amp;amp;p_srch_results_page=0"&gt;New York State articles of
Incorporation&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;just
about January 1st of 2010. From there we have expanded spaces starting
out at a meager 200 sq ft temporary space, moving to a 500 sq ft space,
and eventually to our current home which is over 1200 sq ft. Our
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.interlockroc.org/wiki/index.php/Mission_Statement"&gt;mission
statement&lt;/a&gt;
has been the same since its inception, to provide a space to its members
and the community, as well as be an organization that helps individuals
developer their skills in science, art, and technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="our-present"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Present&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, we had a wide range of accomplishments from our members. Here
are a list of things have been working on recently:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reverse engineering Ms. Pac-Man&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using thermite and tannerite in fun ways&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take EdX, Coursera, classes together: Cryptography, in-line power
supplies, calculus, basic electronics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a high power antennae with low amounts of money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security research using open source intelligence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a Raspberry Pi and home sensors to graph and monitor
temperature changes in your fridge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Artistically building a gigantic light bulb array (without burning
down your apartment)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Converting your Perl scripts over to BASH (as an excuse to hang out
with your kid)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skip's Adventures in 3D printing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might give you an idea of the completely different background that
our members have, but with the common denominator of expanding and
learning more than they do right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

be selling stuff in the space now and letting our members come in and
sell their interesting stuff. For example, we have a bunch of servers,
workstations, ham radio equipment, odd electronics, monitors, etc etc.
We really don't know how much stuff we'll have to get rid of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of the event is to raise money for Interlock so things being
sold by the hackerspace go back into keeping the space going, and
expanding its facilities. We are accepting donations for items that you
find around the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of this event is that starting at 7:00pm, we'll be doing
lightning talks. You can come for the sales, but stay for the
presentations. Lightning talks are 5-10 minute presentations from people
all over the community about nerdy subjects that interest them. If you
have something you'd like to share, come in and show us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll also be giving you food that our members have made you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So TL;DR:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Garage sale 5:00pm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lightning Talks 7:00pm&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, I decided to work on this idea I've had for more than a year
and a half. &lt;strong&gt;The Brain - a silicone based brain with controllable
LEDs inside.&lt;/strong&gt; I have some ideas of what to do next with it, but this
first iteration is just to be a fun decoration for Halloween.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/11/2013-10-27-11.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="2013-10-27-1[1]" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1551" src="/wp-uploads/2013/11/2013-10-27-11-225x300.jpg" style="width: 225px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/11/2013-10-271.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="2013-10-27[1]" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1555" src="/wp-uploads/2013/11/2013-10-271-225x300.jpg" style="width: 225px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="why-the-brain"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why The Brain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when Interlock was moving into their current space, there was this
cool area in the center of it, that was surrounded by windows. That
turned into the network room and I really wanted to use that window for
something. Show something cool in the window or whatever. I came up with
this idea that I would have a brain to represent network activity. When
a host goes down, the brain reflects that. If there was no Internet
connectivity, the brain would show that too. The first version of the
brain is not to that level yet, but it's in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="brain-1-0"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Brain 1.0&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain 1.0 is a Platsil GEL-10, silicone brain with a hollowed center. In
the center is a plastic project box housing an Arduino with Neo Pixels
attached to it. A Neo Pixel is an Adafruit project that is meant to be a
low cost, multi-color LED that you can daisy-chain, or string together
in-line. There's really no reason to use Neo Pixels for this project
besides the fact that I had some already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Halloween Brain Jello mold from Amazon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Platsil GEL-10 from&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.shop.brickintheyard.com/PlatSil-Gel-10-Pint-Kit-2-Lbs-Gel10U2.htm"&gt;BITY Mold
Supply&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tupperware container donated to the cause&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XL Breaking Bad meth making gloves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mixing containers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="making-the-brain"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making the Brain:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the most interesting part to me. I picked up the type of
PlatSil that is a 1 to 1 compound either by volume or by mass so I
didn't need to worry about mixing too much. I took 500ML of A and mixed
it with 500ML of B. This stuff has a 6 minute lifetime from the time you
start mixing to the time it starts to harden. There are ways to slow
this down, but again, I didn't need to do that. I spent 2 minutes mixing
because some guy on YouTube said this is important, and my recent
adventures in Thermite taught me the lesson that they're serious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I poured it in, I used a can of &amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.shop.brickintheyard.com/Pol-Ease-2300-12-Oz-Spray-Can-2300.htm"&gt;Pol-Ease
2300&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;release
which is used to keep the brain separated from the Jello mold. I was
reminded the hard way what happens when you forget this. Pouring it into
the mold was pretty simple but I made a small clay holder for it so I
could make sure it stayed level. After the contents were dumped in, I
sunk the plastic project container that was going to be my hollowed
inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole things hardens within 30 minutes but because mine was in the
garage in October, it was more like an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this stuff isn't very cheap, I did a demo mold just to make sure
I was on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/11/IMG_20131024_16070411.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG_20131024_1607041[1]" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1554" src="/wp-uploads/2013/11/IMG_20131024_16070411-300x225.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 225px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="platsil-gel-10"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PlatSil Gel-10:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal was to create a mold of a brain that was rubbery and brain like.
This Platsil line of chemicals are designed to create molds for other
things. There wasn't a lot of people making actual things from the
material itself but I really like the texture and toughness of using it
as the model. I will say that it is 100% overkill for what I wanted.
There's probably someone that can recommend a
better,&amp;nbsp;cheaper&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;alternative but for me this worked in the time
frame I needed it to. They have a bunch of different types and I really
wanted light to diffuse through it so I got that translucent version. It
still comes out pretty white depending on how thick of a mold you're
making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/11/IMG_20131025_17073011.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG_20131025_1707301[1]" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1556" src="/wp-uploads/2013/11/IMG_20131025_17073011-225x300.jpg" style="width: 225px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="neo-pixel"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Neo Pixel:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neo Pixels are really slick. They have 4 leads on them. Power, Ground,
signal in, and a signal out. The biggest benefit is that each pixel is
individually addressable without the need for multiple connections.
Pixel 0 connects to pixel 1 that connects to pixel N through a single
&amp;nbsp;wire connected to your microcontroller or whatever you're using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power takes +5v, and there is a warning about memory consumption
especially with smaller Arduinos and extremely long chains of Neo Pixels
(up to 500 at 30 FPS). My 4 didn't mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adafruit has a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel"&gt;Neo Pixel
library&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that you can
use pretty easily, even if you just want to hack one of their demos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/11/1060quattro_MED11.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="1060quattro_MED1[1]" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1557" src="/wp-uploads/2013/11/1060quattro_MED11-300x231.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 231px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="arduino"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Arduino:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my hacked code to make the brain throb between red and pink.
Again, a Neo Pixel is overkill for doing this but it's fun none-the-less
and I'll be upgrading it next iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recently had &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/Rob_Bishop"&gt;Rob Bishop&lt;/a&gt; from the
Raspberry Pi foundation stop by Interlock and give a workshop for a
couple of hours, and as we scrambled to prepare -- attempting to pull
together 20 hdmi monitors, 20 usb keyboards, 20 power supplies, et
cetera -- I kept thinking that it'd be nice to be able to play around
with a Pi even if you've arrived unprepared for such an event. So what
follows is &amp;quot;how to fiddle with the Pi GUI with just your laptop, an
ethernet cable, and a micro USB cable&amp;quot;. We're going to start with a
freshly imaged SD card, hook it up to a Mac or Ubuntu laptop through
their internet sharing capabilities, and use VNC to share the GUI over
the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/8248698572/"&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG_4611.jpg" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8209/8248698572_2f0cac271c_z.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="getting-started"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step we'll gloss over is copying a fresh Raspbian image onto
an SD card. This is covered in great detail at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup"&gt;the embedded Linux
wiki&lt;/a&gt;, where they have
plenty of information on setting up the Raspberry Pi. Go there, follow
along, and insert your newly imaged card into your Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="internet-sharing"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Internet Sharing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we're going to prep our laptop to share its internet connection
with the Pi. I know nothing about Windows, but on Ubuntu and Mac OSX,
there are easy ways to share your wifi connection with any computers
that are hooked up to your ethernet port. We'll take these one OS at a
time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/8247471395/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screen shot 2012-12-05 at 4.25.15 PM" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8478/8247471395_775221feba_z.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 490px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming your Mac is connected to a wireless access point, open up the
&amp;quot;Sharing&amp;quot; control panel in System Preferences. Click on the &amp;quot;Internet
Sharing&amp;quot; option, which is probably grayed out at this point. Choose
&amp;quot;Ethernet&amp;quot; as the port you'll share your internet connection out of, and
then turn on Internet Sharing by clicking its checkbox, which should now
be clickable. Done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/8248822966/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot - 12052012 - 07:15:23 PM" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8197/8248822966_1eae0b1a48_o.png" style="width: 434px; height: 325px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This step is equally easy on Ubuntu (and its variants... I use Xubuntu).
Open up the &amp;quot;Network Connections&amp;quot; system preferences. You'll see
something like the above screenshot. Click the big &amp;quot;+ Add&amp;quot; button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/8248822932/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot - 12052012 - 07:16:31 PM" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8339/8248822932_8d72c9e608_o.png" style="width: 409px; height: 464px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll be confronted with something like the above. Name this new
connection something logical. &amp;quot;Connection Sharing&amp;quot; works for my brain.
Click over to the &amp;quot;IPv4&amp;quot; tab and select &amp;quot;Shared to other computers&amp;quot; from
the &amp;quot;method&amp;quot; dropdown. Some people have reported problems with IPv6 at
this point, so click over to that tab and select &amp;quot;Ignore&amp;quot; in the same
dropdown. Save the connection. Carry on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="plugging-in"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Plugging In&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we should be back on the same page for both OSes. Find the shortest
ethernet cable you can and plug your Pi into your laptop's ethernet
port. Nothing should happen. Plug the USB cable into your laptop, and
then into the micro USB port on the Pi. Before doing so, reflect upon
the fact that &lt;strong&gt;the Pi foundation does not recommend you power your Pi
off of a computer's USB port&lt;/strong&gt;. Your computer might not be able to
supply enough power, and/or might burst into flames. I've not had any
such problems, but if your Pi is acting flaky, or if you're planning on
plugging any USB peripherals into the Pi, you may want to sacrifice
MacGyver points and portability in favor of a wall outlet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="sleuthing-ips"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sleuthing IPs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok. We're plugged in with internet tubes and power. Your Pi should be
booting up and making happy blinkies on its status LEDs. After a short
while, it's safe to assume that it has fully booted and grabbed an IP
address from your laptop. Hooray! Open up a terminal and perform the
following incantations to find out what address it was assigned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/8247609327/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screen shot 2012-12-05 at 6.12.15 PM" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8349/8247609327_22f78a3375_o.png" style="width: 585px; height: 366px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Mac, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;cat /private/var/db/dhcpd_leases&lt;/tt&gt; should pop up a block
of text with the desired info. Above, we got an address of 192.168.2.2.
That's probably pretty standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/8247755603/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot - 12052012 - 07:23:02 PM" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8069/8247755603_c53afc8561_o.png" style="width: 600px; height: 414px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Ubuntu Linux, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;cat /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases&lt;/tt&gt; will get you the
same info. In this case, our IP is 10.42.0.26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ssh-and-setting-up-a-vnc-server"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SSH, and Setting Up a VNC Server&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a few more steps. We need to SSH into the Pi. That is, we need to
connect to a command shell on the Pi so we can install a few things to
get our display up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;ssh pi&amp;#64;x.x.x.x&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Substitute the IP you found previously for all the x.x.x.x mayhem at the
end there. It should connect and ask you for the default password, which
is &amp;quot;raspberry&amp;quot;. Now install the vnc server. This is what will transmit
the desktop environment to your laptop:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;apt-get&lt;/span&gt; install tightvncserver&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the VNC server once, and it will ask you to set a password:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;vncserver&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set and remember a password when it prompts you. I just used &amp;quot;raspberry&amp;quot;
again. I'm creative like that. Now we'll run the VNC server for real:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;vncserver :1&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;:1&amp;quot; is the display number. This is necessary because you could
serve multiple virtual displays off of one computer. But lets not get
ahead of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="installing-a-vnc-client"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installing a VNC Client&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're now ready to install the VNC client on our laptop and connect to
the Pi's GUI. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cotvnc/"&gt;Chicken of the
VNC&lt;/a&gt; is a popular Mac
client. Download and install that as per normal. On Ubuntu,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://projects.gnome.org/vinagre/"&gt;Vinagre&lt;/a&gt; is probably the most
popular client. &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;apt-get&lt;/span&gt; install vinagre&lt;/tt&gt; should get it installed
without a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/8248539760/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screen shot 2012-12-05 at 4.52.36 PM" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8065/8248539760_33c9b1642b_o.png" style="width: 509px; height: 314px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost there. Above is the Chicken of the VNC connection dialog. Fill in
the IP address you found previously, and the &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; display number and
password. Click connect and you should be up and running! On Ubuntu, the
command &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;vinagre x.x.x.x:1&lt;/tt&gt; will do the same thing. Yay! You're done.
Celebrate your hard work and dedication while admiring your glorious
accomplishment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/8248701138/"&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG_4617.jpg" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8208/8248701138_078e58a0be_z.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="extra-credit"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Extra Credit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fellow Interlock member
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://geodesicsphere.blogspot.com"&gt;BleuLlama&lt;/a&gt; suggested a way to
make this process a bit easier the second time around. Rather than
hunting down the Pi's IP address (which is admittedly not very difficult
to do), we can use Apple's Bonjour protocol (aka ZeroConf) to have the
Pi announce itself to the network. I found a good writeup on how to do
this, plus how to get the VNC server to start automatically on boot.
Check it out &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4dc5.com/2012/06/12/setting-up-vnc-on-raspberry-pi-for-mac-access/"&gt;at Pat Galea's
blog&lt;/a&gt;.
You can ignore the part about installing Netatalk unless you care about
Mac file sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you're done with your extra credit, you'll have a Pi that you can
plug into your ethernet and USB ports, wait a minute or two, and it'll
pop up automatically in Chicken of the VNC or Vinagre (or any Bonjour
enabled VNC client, of course).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've been tinkering lately with taking pictures for &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.theopencrowdproject.com/"&gt;the Open Crowd

&lt;p&gt;The model shown here isn't their best work, as we provided sub-par
imagery for our first attempt. We're submitting some better shots now,
so we'll see if our process has improved enough to give some higher
resolution models. Once we're good to go and have this process down, you
should feel free to stop in sometime and get yourself digitized!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oops. We've got another pen plotter at Interlock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}/plottopotamus.rst"&gt;mentioned
before&lt;/a&gt; that I've

&lt;p&gt;Oops. We've got another pen plotter at Interlock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, I had been trying to think of easy/cheap ways to get a pencil
working on the device. A normal pencil will only get so far before it
needs sharpening, and none of my plotters have yet become talented
enough to lumber over to the pencil sharpener. Soo...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/6779620792/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Pencil Plotter 1" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7041/6779620792_76736d9442_z.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tada! Did you know they make mechanical pencils that auto-advance their
lead? I didn't, until this was mentioned on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://music.columbia.edu/mailman/listinfo/chiplotle-discuss"&gt;a mailing
list&lt;/a&gt;
I'm on for discussing the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://music.columbia.edu/cmc/chiplotle/"&gt;Chiplotle&lt;/a&gt; python plotter
library (and plotters in general).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick Amazon Prime-ing of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I6ZM20"&gt;BIC AI mechanical
pencil&lt;/a&gt; and away we go.
I stuck it into a hollowed out plotter pen, as demonstrated above, and
it seemed to work fine and auto-advance the lead whenever necessary.
Sweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/6925751889/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Pencil Plotter 2" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7187/6925751889_d17b938b7c_z.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for the two of you out there interested in pen plotters, now you
know. For the rest of you, maybe you've got an
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://egg-bot.com/"&gt;Eggbot&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://store.makerbot.com/toolheads/makerbot-unicorn-pen-plotter-kit.html"&gt;Makerbot
Unicorn&lt;/a&gt;
or some cool sort of &lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}/barcamp-rochester.rst"&gt;homebrewed
plotter&lt;/a&gt;... go
get it running with some genuine [STRIKEOUT:100% lead] &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pencil"&gt;mixture of
graphite with clay binder&lt;/a&gt;. And
if you're into drawing and/or robots and/or software, you should stop in
and play with the plotters someday. I'll get you started, so bring in
some vector artwork, and maybe some paper, and we'll see what happens!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've got a 3d printer! It's still a bit &amp;quot;in progress&amp;quot; as far as

&lt;p&gt;The build was pretty involved, but with a group of four folks we managed
to get the majority of the work done in one long Sunday, a time-lapse of
which follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That resulted in the following structure, which just needed to have its
nozzle and build platform installed (and quite a bit of wiring).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/6348815574/"&gt;&lt;img alt="RepRap Huxley Build" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6230/6348815574_82a7a5964f_z.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With surprisingly little calibration and tinkering, we finally got our
first fully printed part last Friday, the semi-traditional &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1046"&gt;whistle
model&lt;/a&gt;. The quality is really
good already, and will get a bit better once we tweak some settings and
really get the machine purring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the nozzle is clogged now, unfortunately. So my goal tonight is
to clear that out and get plastic extruding again, and then try to print
out the interlock logo, which you can see above, extruded from a DXF
file in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.openscad.org/"&gt;openSCAD&lt;/a&gt;. Come visit, and bring a
model you might want to print! There's plenty of inspiration and/or
finished &amp;quot;things&amp;quot; on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/"&gt;Thingiverse&lt;/a&gt; if
you don't know where to start, and we'll have a class soon on how to go
from and idea to a 3d print... so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's true, we've managed to move all of our gear and junk into a new
space. We're in the same building, but we've now got over twice the

&lt;p&gt;It's true, we've managed to move all of our gear and junk into a new
space. We're in the same building, but we've now got over twice the
space, and some delineation between a workshop sort of room, and other
rooms that are more office-like. Above, you can see a shot of the new
workshop. It's pretty close to the size of our entire previous space,
and we're excited to fill it up with useful tools and fun projects. The
first step though, was painting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to having more space, we also finally got roof access. That,
plus a particularly motivated new-ish member (Walter), means that we
already have a respectable antenna farm installed up there, perfect for
the roughly 50% of our membership with ham licenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/6359765801/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Antenna Farm" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6214/6359765801_3fce69d5f9_z.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've set aside a whole room for all the ham gear and a secondary
electronics workbench (although it's already surpassing the main bench
as far as sweet gear goes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/6356820667/"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Ham Shack" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6218/6356820667_69192ab54b_z.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The network goons have a server closet now, so normal humans can be
isolated from the constant whine of small fans and hard drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/6356747205/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Server Room" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6240/6356747205_a4ebf9d8f1_z.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a large room set up as a classroom or conference room, perfect
for some upcoming classes that are in the works, and nicely isolated
from other noisy activities in the space. I reckon we can accommodate a
dozen people per class, if they all need hands-on desk space, and more
if it's just rows of chairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/6356784025/"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Classroom / Conference Room" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6057/6356784025_38d6222dbb_z.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's more to the space that hasn't been shown here. Three more rooms
in fact... some of which we're not quite sure what to do with. If you
want to see more pictures, there's always &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/interlock_roc/pool/"&gt;our flickr

&lt;p&gt;Personally I don't really consider myself a maker and have always been
in the infosec hacker realm. I go to hacker cons like Defcon but Maker
Faire was a new intense gathering of super positive people. Where else
can you say you saw a giant hydrolic fire breathing dragon next to a one
man drum corp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really the only reason I went down was to volunteer at the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.toool.us"&gt;TOOOL&lt;/a&gt; booth with a couple of friends. I spent
the weekend teaching kids and adults how to pick locks. I'll just say
that I don't hang around kids very much but teaching an 8 year old how
to pick locks was pretty freaking cool. But the highlight of my weekend
was teaching an NYPD officer how to pick a master lock.&lt;/p&gt;

toy, a Roland DPX-3300 pen plotter... delivered via ebay from the
magical futurepast of the early nineties. For those that are out of the
loop with the past century, pen plotters are two axis robo-thingamajigs
that basically pick up pens and draw on paper with them. They've been
replaced by wide-format inkjet printers, but they used to be quite
popular with anybody who wanted to plot out maps, blueprints, and other
large diagrams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/5937490274/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Interlock Plotty Pictures 1" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6125/5937490274_0b95dfca21.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 333px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, somehow I caught the plotter bug, even going so far as to learn
a bit of python after finding this neat library called
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://music.columbia.edu/cmc/chiplotle/"&gt;Chiplotle&lt;/a&gt; that handles
the basics of creating and streaming artwork to plotters using their
native language of HPGL. They have a mailing list where they often point
out good plotter deals on ebay, and I foolishly/accidentally purchased
perhaps the biggest flatbed plotter out there. 3x2 feet of plotting
goodness, 100 pounds of steel and stepper motors delivered to my door by
a grumpy UPS driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/5936937271/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Interlock Plotty Pictures 2" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6009/5936937271_0e87fb9250.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 333px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After realizing it doesn't fit anywhere in my house, I brought it to
Interlock and have been tinkering with it since. The first step was to
convert old dried out plotter pens into pen holders that would allow me
to use Sharpies or other art pens with the device. That involved a quick
trip to the lathe, which I hope to document more fully in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/5936918129/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Interlock Plotty Pictures 3" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6006/5936918129_7d4e1d4a2e.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 333px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having figured out an inexpensive pen solution, I really wanted to make
drawings based on webcam input... so I trawled around the internet and
mailing lists until I could piece together a passable solution using
OpenCV's python bindings, and a series of nerdy unixy commands (convert,
autotrace, and pstoedit) to trace, mush, and output the data. You can
find the relevant code up on my &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beardicus/ronald_toys%20"&gt;Ronald
Toys&lt;/a&gt; Github repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/5937423454/"&gt;&lt;img alt="RoboPortraits" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6125/5937423454_df75c66a42.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 333px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having conquered such menial tasks, I decided that the default route the
plotter was taking was quite inefficient, with lots of time spent
seeking back and forth between lines. My precious robot was spending
half its time flailing due to a poorly composed hpgl file. Surely there
was a better way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beardicus/ronald_tools%20"&gt;Tada!&lt;/a&gt; I wrote a
really dumb sort routine that attempts to minimize seeking between
lines, instead of blindly accepting the order that autotrace wrote them
in. You can see the difference in the following two time-lapse videos.
The first shows the default route that autotrace produces, and the
second is my optimized version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next step for this project: some more sophisticated drawing routines,
including some cross-hatched shading, color, and maybe even some 3D
input from a Kinect. Stop in for a Tuesday Open Night and maybe you can
be a robo-portrait guinea pig!&lt;/p&gt;

Although the parts are designed to be easily cut by hand, I really
wanted an excuse to see some big-ass lasers and to make the acquaintance
of those in charge of said equipment. So off we went. Keep scrolling for
pictures and some commentary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gary – the co-owner of Smidgens, along with his wife Rita – gave us
quite an extensive tour, and answered all of our pesky questions while
we gawked at the machinery. Above, you can see one of their lasers
cutting crane parts out of quarter-inch steel. I was pretty surprised
how quiet the whole operation was, given the amount of cutting going on.
Most of the noise was from the ventilation systems that were constantly
huffing smoke out to the great outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/5333845225/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Overall Shop" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5044/5333845225_5646c6a98a.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 333px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the butt-shot, but here's an overall view of the main space.
There's one more marking laser in another room off to the right, and the
metal-cutting laser is to your left. They also have a bit of storage in
the corner for commonly used materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/5333861475/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Interlock tours Smidgens 2" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5166/5333861475_cae8c0e05a.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 333px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They had three lasers like the above, and these mostly do wood and
acrylic cutting and etching. I failed to shoot the 8-ish foot long laser
tube, the massive power supply, and the ridiculously beefy stepper
(servo?) motors driving the XY tables. So sorry. It really made the
nerds go all giggity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/5333840359/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Marilyn Toast" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5041/5333840359_742bd8ed24.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 333px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bread. Dried, lasered, lacquered. It's a miracle! Rita does some fun
stuff with the lasers that I'm sure their engineers hadn't anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/5334435084/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Marking Machine" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5010/5334435084_1e22090647.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 333px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This machine was solely for cutting thin materials or marking things at
an insane speed. Instead of moving the entire workpiece or optics in an
XY fashion, it has two mirrors that remain stationary and just twiddle
the beam to and fro. The design you see above took about ten or fifteen
seconds to cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/5333865857/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mill Parts" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5289/5333865857_8d8ede5901.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 333px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here are the parts! Time for assembly... soon enough we'll be

weekly electronics course with instructor Carl Schmidtmann. This is a
five week class that is open to members and non-members alike, and will
provide attendees with an introduction to basic electronic components
and circuits, as well as the tools and instruments used to build and
test them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-to-expect"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What To Expect&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this course you should be able to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify common components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read a schematic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build basic circuit board projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design your own circuits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labs will be assigned each week and can be completed at home or at the
space. Informal sessions will be held on Thursday nights for those
looking to get more one-on-one time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The supplies needed for this course will include (but are not limited
to) a soldering iron, bread board, resistors, capacitors, and LEDs. A
limited quantity of these items are available at the space, but will
need to be returned and properly sorted when finished. Availability
will, of course, be dependent on attendance. We have also received
offers to borrow larger equipment, such as oscilloscopes, but these are
expensive and in short supply, so please be careful and share
accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the five weeks, we may continue with more in-depth
coverage of specific topics like motor control, sensors, or
microprocessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course is free to all, but donations from non-members are strongly
encouraged and greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="when-and-where"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When And Where&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These classes will take place every Tuesday at 8:00PM from October 12th
until November 9th. For further information or to get directions to the
space, please visit the
