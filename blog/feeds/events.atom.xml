be selling stuff in the space now and letting our members come in and
sell their interesting stuff. For example, we have a bunch of servers,
workstations, ham radio equipment, odd electronics, monitors, etc etc.
We really don't know how much stuff we'll have to get rid of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of the event is to raise money for Interlock so things being
sold by the hackerspace go back into keeping the space going, and
expanding its facilities. We are accepting donations for items that you
find around the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of this event is that starting at 7:00pm, we'll be doing
lightning talks. You can come for the sales, but stay for the
presentations. Lightning talks are 5-10 minute presentations from people
all over the community about nerdy subjects that interest them. If you
have something you'd like to share, come in and show us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll also be giving you food that our members have made you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So TL;DR:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Garage sale 5:00pm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lightning Talks 7:00pm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Food and drinks served&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outsiders welcome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help us raise money and clean up the space!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

suppose those that have them might post them later--but in the meantime
I figured I'd give a quick recap of my experience at our open house
Friday, before it fades too much further from active memory into the
realm of myth and legend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was, in short, a great time.&amp;nbsp; We had a fairly good variety of folks
wander through, from pre-teens on up.&amp;nbsp; I spent a while fishing out from
a small water-filled [STRIKEOUT:crockpot] slow cooker &lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}/dashing-through-the-thermoplastic-2.rst"&gt;fun little blobs
of warm
polycaprolactone&lt;/a&gt;
These I then shoved into the hands of anyone who would take them as they
wandered through our conference/presentation/meeting room. It was great
seeing folks' reaction to its warm, pliable nature and to listen to them
comment about how tough and rigid it is once cooled.&amp;nbsp; It's a very
minimalistic but (at least I'd like to think) very representative
demonstration of the interactive, collaborative, exploratory,&amp;nbsp; hand's-on
environment we try to provide at Interlock to members and guests alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a bit of a break from running my mouth and from noodling around
in the hot water and gooey PCL&amp;nbsp; to watch&amp;nbsp; a short but sweet
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://toool.us/"&gt;TOOOL&lt;/a&gt;-designed lockpicking slideshow, followed by
a lockpicking workshop.
&lt;a class="reference external" href="/author/antitree.html"&gt;Antitree&lt;/a&gt; had done the
pied-piper trick, drawing a bunch of kids-in-fact and kids-at-heart into
the conference room for a short statement of the lock picking rules, a
little bit of lock construction and mechanism theory and picking
how-to.&amp;nbsp; Then everyone took turns with the several sets of lock picking
tools and real locksets for some hand's-on experience.&amp;nbsp; Folks really
seemed to have a good time with trying it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in the space, all the folks &lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}/open-house-new-space.rst"&gt;originally promised to
appear&lt;/a&gt; were
around.&amp;nbsp; I can only guess at how awesome their presentations were, but
there seemed to be people everywhere.&amp;nbsp; Early on, I was worried no one
would make it into the not-a-kitchen for snacks, but that turned out to
be not-a-problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure how much of the traffic was driven by word-of-mouth versus
posted fliers, but I know at least some folks had seen our &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rochestercitynewspaper.com/entertainment/pop-culture/2012/03/The-gee+k-guide-to-Rochester/"&gt;lead-off
part in a feature in the independent weekly tabloid Rochester City
Newspaper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lead-up to the open house rekindled a fire under some of our 3D
printing aspirations.&amp;nbsp; I don't want to give too much away there, but
that's been bubbling along these last few weeks.&amp;nbsp; And, in addition to
folks who made it on Friday, we've also been having new folks continue
to come in for our weekly Open Night.&amp;nbsp; This week, we met John, who
brought us some fun new-to-us toys (again, perhaps more on that later,
but in the meantime, thanks, John!).&amp;nbsp; Also, we got to meet and talk to
(a different, distinct) Joe and Andrew.&amp;nbsp; And so it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you came to visit us Friday, we hope you liked what you saw and will
come back.&amp;nbsp; If you missed it, not to worry:&amp;nbsp; Please keep an eye on our
calendar for other events (at least two every week).&amp;nbsp; Or, if you can't
make it then, drop us a line and maybe we can work out an appointment
for some other time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the January Linux Workshop several people needed their systems

&lt;p&gt;The other project was to figure out how to downgrade FireFox on Ubuntu.
FireFox 9 broke a plugin but there appears to be no way to downgrade
back to FireFox 8 on Ubuntu. Apparently all the older versions of
FireFox have been removed from the repositories. The older version can
be downloaded and installed manually but the requirement is for a simple
maintainable way to install so old laptops can be supplied to kids with
the kid friendly FireFox plugin. The plugin is just a version of a
Windows app that uses IE so now the challenge will be to see if that app
will run in wine. Maybe we'll have an answer by next month.&lt;/p&gt;

but it's only 5 minutes long. We'd like to have everyone involved. The
more presentations we have the better. The only rules is, you have 5
minutes and you will be timed!&lt;/p&gt;
