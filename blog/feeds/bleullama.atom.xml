of these will become links in the future, as we add more detailed
descriptions about the projects... &amp;nbsp;(from left to right)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a brief recap of our experiences with the event...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We ran out of 160 fliers. &amp;nbsp;I should have printed more. &amp;nbsp;I just didn't
understand the volume of demand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One potentiometer failed hard on Walter. &amp;nbsp;His mouth wouldn't open
correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We ran out of fliers! &amp;nbsp;We had so much interest that all 160 fliers
were gone! &amp;nbsp;(see below for the solution key for the puzzles on the
back!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check-in and interaction with all event people was awesome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dan ran another great event! Thanks Dan!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had 4 members who were there for the full day, running demos and
talking with people. (Scott, Carl, Bill HK, Joe)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH! &amp;nbsp;:D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carl brought a delicious pastry for us all to share, and Bill brought
some refreshing water. THANK YOU!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, it was a great day, and I am super thankful to you all for
participating!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; On the back of our handout (before we ran out of them) were a
few puzzles to do. &amp;nbsp;In case you got stuck on them, or want to check your
work, here are the solutions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a class="reference external" href="/"&gt;Interlock&lt;/a&gt;, JustBill handed me the old
controller board for a gutted 3D printer that he was rebuilding. &amp;quot;Do
whatever you want with this.&amp;quot; A close inspection of the board showed
that it had a main microcontroller of the ATmega 1280, which is the chip
used in older Arduino Megas. &amp;nbsp;The interface to USB however was an ATmega
8u2, which is the chip used in newer Arduino Megas, and you may also
know it from older Arduino Unos... modern Uno R3s use a 32u4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This board had custom firmware on it so that it didn't look like an
Arduino, or any sort of serial connection to the host computer it's
plugged into... so as-is, it was useless for general use as an Arduino;
taking advantage of the GUI and clicky-clicky programmer interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my thought was, it might be nice to have my own 'Mega for testing and
such. &amp;nbsp;Could this board be set up in a way that might make this process
and outcome easy? &amp;nbsp;Turns out it mostly was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original board got its power from a power terminls on the board,
24V. &amp;nbsp;It needed to power the stepper motors, and such so it needed to be
beefy. &amp;nbsp;This was dropped down to 5 and 3.3 on the board itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a USB B jack for connecting this to a host computer, which did
not have its 5V connected, so my thought was, what if i hooked up this
5V to the USB jack. &amp;nbsp;would that be enough to power the chips?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PBreWXxPx_U/VslDf1YJClI/AAAAAAAADdM/_a0TAusuQvk/s1600/FullSizeRender.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PBreWXxPx_U/VslDf1YJClI/AAAAAAAADdM/_a0TAusuQvk/s640/FullSizeRender.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added this jumper, which connects the +5 on the USB jack to the 5v bus
on the board, and plugged it in, and sure enough, it beeped and came to
life without its host power supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up would be reprogramming the micros to have the arduino bootloader
and code on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gPvnDEyf8aY/VslDp2zR3mI/AAAAAAAADdY/H0kpGhzhA98/s1600/IMG_0702.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="aligncenter" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gPvnDEyf8aY/VslDp2zR3mI/AAAAAAAADdY/H0kpGhzhA98/s640/IMG_0702.JPG" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hooked up my fairly cheesy Arduino D-15 (hacked stepper motor
controller) ISP to the 6 pin header, which thankfully was already
populated and labelled on the board! &amp;nbsp;I plugged it into the port
labelled &amp;quot;1280 ISP&amp;quot;, selected the Arduino Mega, with 1280 micro from the
Arduino 1.6.6 menus, selected Arduino ISP for the programmer, then
selected &amp;quot;load bootlader&amp;quot;. &amp;nbsp;In about a minute, it seemed to have
completed successfully.... if something didn't jive, it would have
spewed out sync or device errors to the screen... &amp;nbsp;Seemed good so far!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, was hooking it up to the jack labelled 8u2 ISP. &amp;nbsp;This was a little
trickier because I wasn't installing the bootloader (which the Arduino
IDE makes REALLY easy to do), but rather the secondary micro's firmware,
which basically was just a USB-Serial interface driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, I grabbed the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/tree/master/hardware/arduino/avr/firmwares/atmegaxxu2"&gt;8u2 code from github,
&amp;quot;MEGA-dfu_and_usbserial_combined.hex&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;,
and used the following command line (using a mixture of the code on that
page, with the parameters that my system used via the arduino IDE on my
Mac:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; ./avrdude -p at90usb82 -F -cstk500v1 -P/dev/cu.usbserial-A800czia
-b19200 -U flash:w:8u2.hex&amp;nbsp; -U lfuse:w:0xFF:m -U hfuse:w:0xD9:m -U
efuse:w:0xF4:m -U lock:w:0x0F:m
-C/Users/me/Library/Arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avrdude/6.0.1-arduino5/etc/avrdude.conf&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, it sets the CPU to at90usb82, uses the stk500v1 communications
protocol over the /dev/cu.usbserial driver, at 19200 baud.... it
programs the file 8u2.hex, sets fuses and sets other avrdude
configuration stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lots of text scrolling by from running that, I was able to drop a
program I was working on, onto it via the Arduino IDE directly, without
any problems at all! I set the port to the serial Mega, set the board to
&amp;quot;Arduino Mega&amp;quot;, cpu set at &amp;quot;Mega 1280&amp;quot;, clicked 'upload' and bam, fully
functional serial communications from the serial montior down through to
the '1280 on the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qazqVuRpJJo/VslDhbqR7WI/AAAAAAAADdc/_wIVTC-xUHA/s1600/IMG_0700.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qazqVuRpJJo/VslDhbqR7WI/AAAAAAAADdc/_wIVTC-xUHA/s640/IMG_0700.JPG" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoo! Free Arduino Mega for me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit: Here's the pinouts of stuff I beeped out. The number is the
digital (or Analog where applicable) pin on an Arduino Mega board. &amp;nbsp;So
digital 24 from Arduino corrolates to the &amp;quot;A Dir&amp;quot; pad on the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi all! I'd like to formally announce something that we've (kinda) been
working on for a little while now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE INTERLOCK SHELVES OF POTENTIAL AWESOME!&lt;/p&gt;

working on for a little while now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE INTERLOCK SHELVES OF POTENTIAL AWESOME!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a library of sorts... &amp;nbsp;The idea is this: &amp;nbsp;If you want to try out
one of the dev kits that are there, you can&amp;nbsp;sign them out for your own
use. &amp;nbsp;Preferrably something that you will write a blog post for. ;) &amp;nbsp;but
even if you just want to sit down with one and mess with it for a week
or two, go for it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a list of what's currently available on the shelf:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://tinyurl.com/ks6gdtu"&gt;http://tinyurl.com/ks6gdtu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that list you will find an inventory ID that matches the ID on the
tag attached to each package. &amp;nbsp;You will also find a contact person who
may be able to help or at least point you in the right direction for
what these things are, how to use them, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, these items are borrow-only. &amp;nbsp;We are working on a way for these
items to be purchasable in the future. &amp;nbsp;For example, if you start using
one, and integrate it into your awesome project, we would like for there
to be a way for you to purchase it from the space. If there's something
you want to borrow, contact Scott to check it out. We'll eventually have
some sort of fancy computer-assisted self-operated inventory system, but
for now, we'll go with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are looking for more borrow-donations for the shelf! If you have
more, please let us know! &amp;nbsp;I'd like to make more Arduino boards
available, as well as modernish laptops and possibly retro computers for
people to borrow and play with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the near future, I will be setting up a laptop or two with a guest
account to be stored there for borrowing in case you want to work on
something at the space but forgot your own kit at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a CD case disguised as a &amp;quot;1997 MSDN Subscription&amp;quot; box.
&amp;nbsp;This is currently filled with empty disc sleeves, but in the future, it
will be populated with various install media for various old and new
hardware. &amp;nbsp;I will be bringing in disc media for some obsolete systems to
be put in there. I'd like for one of you Linux Master Craftspeople to
burn a copy or two of the current preferred
desktop/server/32/64/whatever discs to be stored in there. &amp;nbsp;We will
catalog the contents as things get added.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;nbsp;Apparently, something went bad with the USB connector, and his kid was
very persistent with trying to get the charging cable into it, and
completely mangled the connector. &amp;nbsp;Then he tried to fix it too, which
made things worse... including chewing up the outer frame. &amp;nbsp;He ordered a
replacement USB connector and asked if I could fix it. &amp;nbsp;It sounded like
a fun project so.. sure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had already popped the back off at some point, so I just popped it
back off again. &amp;nbsp;The USB port had to be desoldered from the board.
&amp;nbsp;Little did I know that it also was glued down. &amp;nbsp;That made it a bit
difficult to remove from the board&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2015/04/CCCTy4iWAAMfjrm.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="2015-04-07 20.49.45" class="wp-image-1947 aligncenter" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2015/04/2015-04-07-20.49.45-300x225.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a lot of extra solder, and some leverage with the tweezers, I did
manage to get it off. &amp;nbsp;Some work with the vacuum pump desolderer, some
desoldering braid, and cleanup with rubbing alcohol and the mainboard
was ready for the replacement part. &amp;nbsp;(Sharpie for scale)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2015/04/2015-04-07-21.25.38.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="2015-04-07 21.25.38" class="wp-image-1948 aligncenter" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2015/04/2015-04-07-21.25.38-300x225.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting it lined up so that all of the pads matched up and that the
connector's opening would line up with the case was a little bit tricky.
&amp;nbsp;I soldered this one&amp;nbsp;on with too-large of a tip by doing the &amp;quot;flooding
the pads&amp;quot; method. Then excess solder was removed with some braid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2015/04/2015-04-07-21.43.35.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="2015-04-07 21.43.35" class="wp-image-1949 aligncenter" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2015/04/2015-04-07-21.43.35-225x300.jpg" style="width: 277px; height: 369px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I fully reassembled it, I tried out the jack, and it worked! I
filed down and smoothed out the edge to remove any broken frame bits, to
fix the damage done the first time it was opened, and powered it on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2015/04/2015-04-07-21.48.01.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="CCCTy4iWAAMfjrm" class="wp-image-1946 aligncenter" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2015/04/CCCTy4iWAAMfjrm-300x225.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The best way to test it, and the best way to go a bit
insane is to get a chorus of Talking Ginger and other talking animals
going... They were repeating each other, degrading the sound more and
more with each repetition... We were pretty punchy at the end of the
evening...&lt;/p&gt;

here... &amp;lt;http://day.arduino.cc&amp;gt;`__*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be running an Arduino project challenge contest! Using an
Arduino (or related micro), along with any resources and tools in the
Interlock space, and/or materials you bring yourself,&amp;nbsp;what cool thing
can you build? &amp;nbsp;Some old hardware (printers, scanners, misc parts) will
be available to take apart... Judging will happen at 9:30, points will
be awarded for usefulness, niftiness, artistic quality, and technical
depth... &amp;nbsp; The winner(s) will get something, to be determined. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the day, we'll have the doors open for all who want to visit
and participate, or just check us and our space out. We'll be around all
day to help you with your Arduino project, or get help from you on our
projects! ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:00 am - Doors open, Coffee will be available, get settled in, get to
know each other. Project workshop time as well (throughout the day)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11:00 am - Intro to Arduino - What it is, how to use it, some basic
interfacing with buttons and lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noon - Lunch! &amp;nbsp;Sub sandwiches and beverages will be available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1:00 pm - Project Circus - show off your project. &amp;nbsp;casual presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2:00 pm - Arduino Communications - How to get your computer to talk with
the Ardy, and get them to talk with devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3:00 pm - Analog interfacing with Alex - how to work with other kinds of
peripherals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4:00 pm - &amp;nbsp;Project Circus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5:00 pm - Dinner! Pizza and beverages will be available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:00 pm - Workshop Time (or TBD)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:00 pm - Workshop Time&amp;nbsp;(or TBD)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8:00 pm - Workshop Time&amp;nbsp;(or TBD)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9:00 pm - Project Challenge voting! (at 9:30)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:00 pm - End of the event. &amp;nbsp;We'll probably stick around for a while
anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

rearranged things a bit. &amp;nbsp;The goal was to have more workspace for the
Arduino Day workshops, and to have things on display that were more
representative of who we are. &amp;nbsp;We installed a few shelves to store
projects-in-development (that don't fit or we don't want to put them in
our lockers or offices), as well as to show off some completed projects.
&amp;nbsp;The shelves are a bit bare right now, but we'll fill them up soon
enough! &amp;nbsp;Here are some pics to show what the place is like right now...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been getting into making stained glass pieces, as I've been taking
a class at the Rochester Memorial Art Gallery. &amp;nbsp;One of the tools they
have available there is a light box, which I have used to make the
template for the macaw piece I'm making. &amp;nbsp;I used it to help me adapt a
pattern I found online into something that better suits my needs. &amp;nbsp;I
traced it, then retraced that sketch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The light box also works well to see how things look with light behind
them, however it's not something I can use a lot for this, since my
project is a couple dozen pieces of glass and we have to share the light
box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the recycle pile at work was a couple of old, broken laptops. &amp;nbsp;I
snagged two of them; one with an LED backlight, and one with a CCFT
backlight. &amp;nbsp;I thought that the LED one would be easier to get working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over at &lt;a class="reference external" href="/"&gt;Interlock&lt;/a&gt;, I tore apart the
screens, tossing out the LCD panel, so I was left with just the light
source, light guide, diffusion screens, and control circuitry. &amp;nbsp;Its
control/driver board also managed the LCD itself. &amp;nbsp;There were many test
points on the back, so I applied power to the &amp;quot;LED PWR&amp;quot; pin, ground to a
ground point, then about +5 volts to the BLEN (assuming it to be
&amp;quot;backlight enable&amp;quot;) as well as the &amp;quot;PWM&amp;quot; test point. After futzing with
it for a little bit, I gave up and focused efforts on the CCFT-based
one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slightly larger CCFT (Fluorescent) based one had a single board that
connected to the backlight tube through standard white/pink
silicone-insulated wiring. &amp;nbsp;The board itself had one tiny connector on
one side with a few pins that seemed to have obvious use. &amp;nbsp;V+, which
assumably powers the backlight circuitry, should be connected to +5 or
maybe +12. &amp;nbsp;GND, which of course is ground. Then two other connections
&amp;quot;EN&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;CTRL&amp;quot;, which I guessed to be &amp;quot;Enable&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Control&amp;quot;. &amp;nbsp;A guess
would be to tie these to a logic &amp;quot;high&amp;quot; which might maybe enable the
thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I connected just the V+ and GND to a power supply, and applied power.
&amp;nbsp;Ranging from 0v up through 12v yielded no results. I connected the
other two logic lines to power too, and started ramping up the power.
&amp;nbsp;At around 7v, the backlight flickered on, but then wouldn't do anything
until I brought the power back to 0v, and then back up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a hunch, I figured that the backlight needs a higher voltage, and the
logic stays at TTL levels. &amp;nbsp;Applying the same power to both would give a
possible point between the two where both kinda worked, which is where I
saw the flicker. &amp;nbsp;I hacked together two power supplies, with grounds
tied together, 5v from one power brick, and the V+ to the variable
supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9We5elFk1J8/VFpB9JnXiDI/AAAAAAAAC7w/UR087-rhETA/s1600/2014-11-04%2B22.18.15.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F1.bp.blogspot.com%2F-9We5elFk1J8%2FVFpB9JnXiDI%2FAAAAAAAAC7w%2FUR087-rhETA%2Fs1600%2F2014-11-04%252B22.18.15.jpg&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ramped up the voltage, and sure enough, it would get dim around 7v,
then go full brightness around 12v. &amp;nbsp;It seemed to use about 300mA to
drive it too. Good to know. &amp;nbsp;I found a 12v power brick and.. it would
light for about 20 seconds then power itself off. &amp;nbsp;The 12v brick put out
18v.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I eventually found a brick that worked, so i hooked up two supplies, a
5v and a 12v and it was stable and bright. &amp;nbsp;Next would be the task to
put in a 5v regulator to provide the 5v it needs, so i can run it all on
one single power supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple circuit using a 7805 and two capacitors later, and I have 12v
in, and a backlight lit! &amp;nbsp;I wrapped the circuit in tape (purple because
it was there), hooked it up to a power connector, and reassembled the
case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qaXCEb0O6bA/VFpB9O9cu6I/AAAAAAAAC70/f4be5tcJKVU/s1600/2014-11-04%2B22.59.53.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F2.bp.blogspot.com%2F-qaXCEb0O6bA%2FVFpB9O9cu6I%2FAAAAAAAAC70%2Ff4be5tcJKVU%2Fs1600%2F2014-11-04%252B22.59.53.jpg&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best of all, it all managed to fit within the old plastics. Huzzah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I just need to put something on the diffusers to protect them from
cut glass, maybe a piece of plexi, or even a large Ziplock or plastic
wrap, and I'll be set!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to package up my JAMMA test rig so that I could demo Crazy
Otto at Rochester BarCamp for today. &amp;nbsp;My design was basically a box that
would house the entire thing, with a nice control panel for player 1.
&amp;nbsp;As you can see in the above image, I have the A/V cable going to an
external monitor. &amp;nbsp;Broken out on the box are player 1 and 2 start, coin
1, and player 1 controls - joystick and 3 buttons. &amp;nbsp;On the right side of
the box are the three &amp;quot;coin box&amp;quot; controls -- Test, Tilt, and Service,
for testing those functions of the board. &amp;nbsp;Also on that side is a nice
handle to help it be portable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a continuation of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://geodesicsphere.blogspot.com/2014/02/updating-my-jamma-test-rig.html"&gt;part 1, where I updated the AV connections
of the
rig&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nDP_92M4YFM/U1M0gHY_jeI/AAAAAAAACwE/cfeMOS1ekec/s1600/2014-04-08+21.33.00.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F4.bp.blogspot.com%2F-nDP_92M4YFM%2FU1M0gHY_jeI%2FAAAAAAAACwE%2FcfeMOS1ekec%2Fs1600%2F2014-04-08%2B21.33.00.jpg&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="width: 300px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is about the extent of blueprints I have for this. &amp;nbsp;I knew I needed
14&amp;quot; depth for the monitor, and that it needed about a 2&amp;quot; rise from the
back to the front to put it at a good angle. &amp;nbsp;I wanted it to be 18&amp;quot;
wide, and 24&amp;quot; deep. &amp;nbsp;That would give enough room for a game board inside
of it, as well as for a decent sized control panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vj7FRtuwaoI/U1M2uUih-PI/AAAAAAAACwY/jM8BsjZHRrs/s1600/2014-04-08+23.19.01.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F2.bp.blogspot.com%2F-vj7FRtuwaoI%2FU1M2uUih-PI%2FAAAAAAAACwY%2FjM8BsjZHRrs%2Fs1600%2F2014-04-08%2B23.19.01.jpg&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started by cutting a sheet of plywood I've had in our garage
for a while. &amp;nbsp;I also built the control panel using spare parts I had.
&amp;nbsp;Thanks to members of Interlock to help me use the table saw, suggest
tools and offer bits of wood. &amp;nbsp;:D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some standard microswitch buttons, and a nice ball-top leaf-switch
joystick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cydJ39iIQvw/U1M3gCeS2fI/AAAAAAAACwo/1n4QMzmT-YE/s1600/2014-04-13+00.02.24.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image5" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F1.bp.blogspot.com%2F-cydJ39iIQvw%2FU1M3gCeS2fI%2FAAAAAAAACwo%2F1n4QMzmT-YE%2Fs1600%2F2014-04-13%2B00.02.24.jpg&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic construction is that I glued some cleats on the inside of each
side. Then the back, bottom, front and control panel will be screwed to
it. &amp;nbsp;After that, it looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3K5F7U_IA6Q/U1M4kGWWFKI/AAAAAAAACw4/LiOxY_9eV34/s1600/2014-04-15+23.18.31.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image6" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F3.bp.blogspot.com%2F-3K5F7U_IA6Q%2FU1M4kGWWFKI%2FAAAAAAAACw4%2FLiOxY_9eV34%2Fs1600%2F2014-04-15%2B23.18.31.jpg&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also cut and drilled a small metal bracket to hold the power supply in
place, which you can see in the above. &amp;nbsp;The coin 1 button on the front
has a 12v light in it. &amp;nbsp;The old P2 controller is still attached to the
JAMMA rig, in case I want to test/play 2 player games. &amp;nbsp;You can also see
the 1 1/4&amp;quot; fine thread drywall screws holding it together here. &amp;nbsp;From
here, the only change is that I painted it, stinking up our garage in
the process. heh. &amp;nbsp;The top lid hooks under the control panel, and has a
cleat in the back to keep it from sliding off the back. &amp;nbsp;There's a
single screw to hold it in place, and to let it be carried withot the
contents falling out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eZu5wH69luQ/U1M5zDFWpfI/AAAAAAAACxM/jCR3iqEw1F4/s1600/2014-04-19+16.57.49.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image8" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F2.bp.blogspot.com%2F-eZu5wH69luQ%2FU1M5zDFWpfI%2FAAAAAAAACxM%2FjCR3iqEw1F4%2Fs1600%2F2014-04-19%2B16.57.49.jpg&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="width: 480px; height: 640px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great thing about this thing is that it's easy to tote this thing
around to play/demo games and such. &amp;nbsp;It takes two trips since the
monitor is cumbersome, and the box itself is pretty heavy, but it's
SIGNIFICANTLY easier than toting around a full arcade cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reference, here's the JAMMA pinout standard: &amp;nbsp;(Most games since the
late 1980s use this or a variant of it -- for example, Neo Geo adds
additional buttons on unused pins, Rampart uses a trackball on the
joystick pins, and Mortal Kombat has additional buttons on another
interface harness.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-f-lfNHovg-o/U1M7AMoGZiI/AAAAAAAACxY/RYRHymBXE88/s1600/2014-04-15+21.53.29.gif"&gt;&lt;img alt="image9" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F4.bp.blogspot.com%2F-f-lfNHovg-o%2FU1M7AMoGZiI%2FAAAAAAAACxY%2FRYRHymBXE88%2Fs1600%2F2014-04-15%2B21.53.29.gif&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power and ground at the top portion are wired directly to the old PC
power supply. &amp;nbsp;Coin counters and lockout coils are not wired to
anything. &amp;nbsp;The speaker wires are broken out to a RCA plug, and the Video
(RGB,Sync) are out to a DIN connector, as seen in the previous post.
&amp;nbsp;Service, Tilt, and Test are wired to the three switches on the side of
the box. &amp;nbsp;Coin switch 1, and the two start buttons are on the control
panel, as are all of the 1P controls (on the right).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took over some desk space at Interlock and got to work. &amp;nbsp;(I should
note that the beverages you can see here are other people's, not mine.
;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I traced the audio circuit on a real Pac-Man schematic (seen on my
laptop's monitor), and buzzed it out on the Yenox board to try to
corrolate the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9SZwuigjePY/UuqihQhaOqI/AAAAAAAACqc/lyX0wtzBBfg/s1600/2014-01-30+14.05.06.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F3.bp.blogspot.com%2F-9SZwuigjePY%2FUuqihQhaOqI%2FAAAAAAAACqc%2FlyX0wtzBBfg%2Fs1600%2F2014-01-30%2B14.05.06.jpg&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="width: 480px; height: 640px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to trace four similar paths from a quad flip-flop, through a quad
bidirecional switch, to the audio output. &amp;nbsp;It got really confusing at
times, and took me probably a bit longer than it should have. &amp;nbsp;For the
most part, they were pin-for-pin correct as far as how they were wired.
&amp;nbsp;These chips have the same device (eg, a flip flop, or a logic gate)
repeated 4 or 6 times. &amp;nbsp;In some cases here, the Yenox board had a
different one of these devices hooked up, which added to the confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This portion of the circuit uses 8 resistors to make a digital-to-analog
converter. These generally work by having different resistance levels,
usually something like multiples of eachother, eg, &amp;nbsp;10k ohm, 22k ohm,
47k ohm then 100kohm. &amp;nbsp;I traced out all of the lines on the Yenox board
and I found out that not only were the resistors in the wrong order on
the board, but they were also wildly wrong (47 ohm instead of 4.7k ohm),
which you can see in this table I made:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see these resistors here on the Yenox board, right next to the
JAMMA connector. &amp;nbsp;They start from the left with R1 (my notation.) &amp;nbsp;The
printing on the board completely matched the resistance values that sat
on them, so it's obvious that the engineer who made this board seriously
screwed it up in the design stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MRXGr6YFnAI/Uuqe7IEuznI/AAAAAAAACqA/CEcTI-WDWrg/s1600/2014-01-29+00.00.35.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image4" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F4.bp.blogspot.com%2F-MRXGr6YFnAI%2FUuqe7IEuznI%2FAAAAAAAACqA%2FCEcTI-WDWrg%2Fs1600%2F2014-01-29%2B00.00.35.jpg&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I replaced resistors R3 - R7. &amp;nbsp;I put them in with the gold band closer
to the JAMMA connector, rather than the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now it sounds near-perfect. &amp;nbsp;There's a little bit of popping left,
but I was getting tired and decided to head home for the night. &amp;nbsp;I'll
hook it up to an oscilloscope at some point and see if i can figure out
which line is causing problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For what it's worth, I also did the same as this on the video path DAC,
seen in the above picture as the next three groups of resistors. &amp;nbsp;In the
above, the group of four and then the group of five are for audio, then
the next group of three is for the &amp;quot;red&amp;quot;, next three for &amp;quot;green&amp;quot;, next
two for &amp;quot;blue&amp;quot;, and the remaining two are for the sync. &amp;nbsp;Again, there
were some 47 ohm resistors mixed in, and notice two of the three in the
&amp;quot;green&amp;quot; section are identical (red-red-brown)... which is surely wrong.
&amp;nbsp;Color is now perfect on the board too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many years back, I hooked up a spare JAMMA harness to an old PC power
supply, a monitor and some repurposed joystick pads. &amp;nbsp;(JAMMA is a
standard connector size and pinout to hook up arcade game boards into
arcade cabinets. &amp;nbsp;Most of my arcade game boards are either natively
Jamma (Mortal Kombat, Klax, Block-out) or I have adapters to hook them
up using JAMMA. &amp;nbsp;(Dig-Dug, Pac-Man, etc)). &amp;nbsp;One board that I've been
using with it recently is a knockoff Ms. Pac-Man board, seen in these
photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being that I've been wanting to work on arcadey projects recently at
Interlock, I decided to make this thing a lot less janky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dXu8idF4Gos/UuqcgxrHTTI/AAAAAAAACpw/kglKFQAxKSQ/s1600/2014-01-28+21.15.52.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F1.bp.blogspot.com%2F-dXu8idF4Gos%2FUuqcgxrHTTI%2FAAAAAAAACpw%2FkglKFQAxKSQ%2Fs1600%2F2014-01-28%2B21.15.52.jpg&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The harness/rig I have was always kind of a hack. &amp;nbsp;The video and audio
wires terminated in a small box with some knobs which were meant to
attenuate the signal but never really worked right. &amp;nbsp;The power switch
was on this cord that came out and was weirdly fastened to the side of
the power supply. &amp;nbsp;I decided to clean this up while
at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/"&gt;Interlock&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for open night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZsVc0fKDW7I/Uuqcg9U7owI/AAAAAAAACpk/HtINUUqLkOk/s1600/2014-01-28+21.14.07.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F3.bp.blogspot.com%2F-ZsVc0fKDW7I%2FUuqcg9U7owI%2FAAAAAAAACpk%2FHtINUUqLkOk%2Fs1600%2F2014-01-28%2B21.14.07.jpg&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that I happened to have the right 6 pin DIN
connector for this old RGB monitor (basically a Commodore Amiga 1084
clone). &amp;nbsp; So I wired up Red, Green, Blue, and Ground directly to the
correct pins on it. &amp;nbsp;JAMMA spits out composite video, but this monitor
takes in Horizontal and Vertical sync. &amp;nbsp;I knew that some monitors would
take in composite sync on their Vertical Sync line, so I tried that...
and it worked! Huzzah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only video issue now is that the game boards put out video that's
slightly too hot/too high a voltage, so I should put attenuation
resistors inside the din connector or something...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the JAMMA interface spits out amplified audio, I decided to
hook up an RCA plug on the audio lines anyway, to plug it into the
line-level in on the monitor. &amp;nbsp;As long as I'm careful it will be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ACC-6mHPO68/Uuqcg43SeQI/AAAAAAAACps/Ik2i8_69l8U/s1600/2014-01-28+21.13.46.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F4.bp.blogspot.com%2F-ACC-6mHPO68%2FUuqcg43SeQI%2FAAAAAAAACps%2FIk2i8_69l8U%2Fs1600%2F2014-01-28%2B21.13.46.jpg&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here it is being driven by my Yenox Ms Pac-Man board with the
&amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://umlautllama.com/projects/gamehacks/#horiz"&gt;Horizontal Ms
Pac&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; rom hack.
&amp;nbsp;You can see the power switch sticking out of the side of the power
supply there. &amp;nbsp;It's not the most optimal thing ever, but it's
substantially cleaner than before. &amp;nbsp;Perhaps I'll replace that switch
with a nice carling switch in the future. &amp;nbsp;I'll need this test rig for
the next task, which is fixing the audio on this board. &amp;nbsp;It sounds
horrid...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An early test result, showing text and millseconds since power-on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An early test result, showing text and millseconds since power-on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a year ago, I bought a few 11 digit, 7 segment red LED displays
from Active Surplus up on Queen Street in Toronto. (Excellent store. &amp;nbsp;If
you're into hacking stuff at all, it's well worth the trip. Look for the
monkey on Queen street to find their entrance.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past week, I wasn't sure what to do at Interlock on Tuesday night,
but I had recently re-found these displays, so I figured I would finally
get them working. &amp;nbsp;I hit Radio Shack to get a Seeed Studio Arduino
Shield ($10 with a mess of components, probably the best deal in all of
Radio Shack.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gRsOSI_LtfU/UZZz1mwZnpI/AAAAAAAACb4/or8abBr4-TM/s1600/IMG_1459.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gRsOSI_LtfU/UZZz1mwZnpI/AAAAAAAACb4/or8abBr4-TM/s640/IMG_1459.JPG" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The display with a header soldered on, and the shield with its assorted
parts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was all set to figure out how to reverse-engineer the pinout on the
bottom of the display; I googled for the LED module, and found specs on
those, and then on a whim, decided to check on the entire module board,
a Rohm LU-3011, and found the jackpot,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bobdasquirrel.blogspot.com/2011/08/rohm-lu-3011-led-display-module.html"&gt;this post about figuring out
the
pinout&lt;/a&gt;.
&amp;nbsp;It suddenly became very easy to do this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two key things gleaned from that above post, which I have mirrored
here, are this table of enables for each of the 11 digits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col width="13%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="7%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="7%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="7%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="7%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="7%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="7%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="9%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="9%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="9%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="9%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="9%" /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Digit&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Pin&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and this image, showing the pin mappings of the segments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-O2_Yz-oWDgE/UZZstuDtijI/AAAAAAAACbQ/eLleHoWirVw/s1600/digit.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-O2_Yz-oWDgE/UZZstuDtijI/AAAAAAAACbQ/eLleHoWirVw/s320/digit.JPG" style="width: 320px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mapping of the segments to the pins on the header.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic way these displays work is that all of the 7 segments (plus
one decimal point) are all tied together to the pins specified above.
&amp;nbsp;Then the anodes for each of the displays are broken out to the pins in
the table above. &amp;nbsp;So to draw a '7', you would set all of the segments to
LOW, except for pins 11, 19, and 7 which you set HIGH. &amp;nbsp;Then to turn on
a specific digit, let's say digit 11 (rightmost), you set the digit
enable pin 18 to be an output, and set it LOW. &amp;nbsp;Set all of the other
digit enables to be inputs (tri-state, not low or high), and only
position 11 will show a &amp;quot;7&amp;quot;. &amp;nbsp;You repeat this for all of the 11 digits
in the display, and you can display 11 full digits from just those 19
pins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my code (available below) I start at digit 1, and work down to digit
11, enabling each one, in turn, showing its segments, waiting 1
millisecond, then disable that digit, move on to the next one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I soldered a pin header on the display, and built up a shield to plug it
into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bh1tSeeWrGA/UZZ0MK4HVlI/AAAAAAAACcA/cBy-KgCnyfg/s1600/IMG_1463.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bh1tSeeWrGA/UZZ0MK4HVlI/AAAAAAAACcA/cBy-KgCnyfg/s640/IMG_1463.JPG" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of the digit enables wired up. &amp;nbsp;The top ones are a bit messy. Sorry
about that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wired it up such that the digit enables and segments are wired
directly to IO lines on my Arduino. &amp;nbsp;This used all of the IO lines,
minus the D13 pin, which has an on-board LED.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code that I wrote (available below) lets you do arbitrary digits per
character, so that i can do (primitive) alphanumerics, or do animation
patterns, etc. &amp;nbsp;I also store the decimal point as a separate character
going in to the display code, so &amp;quot;3.141&amp;quot; is five ascii characters going
in, but a flag is set on the '3' position saying that this digit should
also display its decimal point, so it only consumes four digits in the
display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Iu8GH9eT68o/UZZ0WDS63kI/AAAAAAAACcI/HTfpMMcb3Fg/s1600/IMG_1464.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image4" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Iu8GH9eT68o/UZZ0WDS63kI/AAAAAAAACcI/HTfpMMcb3Fg/s640/IMG_1464.JPG" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;just testing out all of the segments and digits&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, it displays a nice clock and some animations on my desk, but I
plan on changing it around a little in the near future. &amp;nbsp;I want to use
the D13 line as one of the segment enables (probably decimal point) and
move the segment enables off of the Serial Receive line. &amp;nbsp;That way i
will be able to control it via serial to display patterns, animations or
text content. &amp;nbsp;Since the hardware serial port is hardwired to 0 and 1,
and I will be using the TX line for the LED displays, I'll have to
instead use the Software Serial, with only its Receive line mapped to an
IO pin, and its Transmit line mapped to junk. I've done this before and
it works well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code for this project is&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/BleuLlama/GeodesicSphere/tree/master/Projects/SevenSegment11"&gt;available in my Geodesic Sphere github

Macaw. &amp;nbsp;Rather than futzing with drawing up detailed plans in some cad
program, Iv'e decided to instead get the basic shape made, and then just
build one out of foam core. &amp;nbsp;My thought was that once I have the shape
worked out, I'll disassemble it and come up with plans for 3d printable
parts that can be attached together, and eventually some vacuum formed
parts as well for the head and beak, which need to be lightweight...
although I'm starting to think that they could all be 3D printed, with a
skin stretched over them for feathers and fur, after seeing&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hackaday.com/?s=acetone"&gt;the posts
on Hack-A-Day about using acetone vapor to smooth out
parts&lt;/a&gt;... anyway..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things I was unsure of was the control linkages, and how the
articulation points can be made. &amp;nbsp;It needs to have a few points of
articulation to match the birds in the Enchanted Tiki Room:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qZOD7wBfc5Y/UTdpnqOh8qI/AAAAAAAACXw/r3R4zyJgR7c/s1600/2013-03-06+11.00.15.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qZOD7wBfc5Y/UTdpnqOh8qI/AAAAAAAACXw/r3R4zyJgR7c/s640/2013-03-06+11.00.15.jpg" style="width: 356px; height: 640px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perch rotation - 270 degrees, spins the bird around (not shown)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lean - +20, -20 degrees, to lean forward and backward at the point
where the legs connect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Head yaw - +45, -45 degrees back and forth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Head tilt - +15, -15 degrees up and down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beak - 30 degrees, could be all open or all closed (shown in the
diagram as 15 degrees)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking that after I constructed the foam version, I could figure
things out from there, but after seeing&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hackaday.com/2013/02/28/3d-printed-hog-drive/"&gt;this post on Hack-A-Day with
a &amp;quot;HOG Drive&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;,
I realized I could leverage off of this design for the head linkages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chatted with Skip at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/"&gt;Interlock&lt;/a&gt;, and
by the end of this last Tuesday evening, I had two 3-D printed versions
of this, using ABS, rather than the PLA material I am
more&amp;nbsp;familiar&amp;nbsp;with. (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:52097"&gt;Here's the Thingiverse link for the
design&lt;/a&gt;.) Since I wasn't
going to be mounting a motor, we (and by &amp;quot;we&amp;quot; I mean &amp;quot;he&amp;quot;) replaced the
motor space with a flat plate with a mounting screw hole. &amp;nbsp;He also
replaced the back control arm with just a peg, since the bridge-like
shape wouldn't hold up properly on his printer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first print (on the left) has a failed control peg on the center
disk. &amp;nbsp;It was adding material onto printed material that didn't cool
yet, so it just kinda globbed up. &amp;nbsp;This was improved by Skip by adding a
second post, seen in the second version on the right. &amp;nbsp;He also added
some material around the screw holes in the frame, to improve
durability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After printing and having this in my hand, I'm realizing that it won't
quite work for me, although it does give me an excellent starting point.
&amp;nbsp;The center disk is too small to mount the head on. &amp;nbsp;It's only about 1
1/2 inches in diameter. I think I'd want something about 2-3&amp;quot; in
diameter, with plenty of mounting points and space for securing the head
,as well as space for wiring for the beak servo (or linear motor, or
solenoid, or whatever). &amp;nbsp;It really showed me the design considerations
for actually constructing something, not to mention it
really&amp;nbsp;emphasized&amp;nbsp;that whatever design I can think of, I can print...
which is pretty&amp;nbsp;futuristically&amp;nbsp;awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the important thing is that I know have ideas to build on for the
final version. &amp;nbsp;I'll still be constructing a foam core model, and I'll
be using this above design as a kick-off point.&lt;/p&gt;

Macaw. &amp;nbsp;Rather than futzing with drawing up detailed plans in some cad
program, Iv'e decided to instead get the basic shape made, and then just
build one out of foam core. &amp;nbsp;My thought was that once I have the shape
worked out, I'll disassemble it and come up with plans for 3d printable
parts that can be attached together, and eventually some vacuum formed
parts as well for the head and beak, which need to be lightweight...
although I'm starting to think that they could all be 3D printed, with a
skin stretched over them for feathers and fur, after seeing&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hackaday.com/?s=acetone"&gt;the posts
on Hack-A-Day about using acetone vapor to smooth out
parts&lt;/a&gt;... anyway..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things I was unsure of was the control linkages, and how the
articulation points can be made. &amp;nbsp;It needs to have a few points of
articulation to match the birds in the Enchanted Tiki Room:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qZOD7wBfc5Y/UTdpnqOh8qI/AAAAAAAACXw/r3R4zyJgR7c/s1600/2013-03-06+11.00.15.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qZOD7wBfc5Y/UTdpnqOh8qI/AAAAAAAACXw/r3R4zyJgR7c/s640/2013-03-06+11.00.15.jpg" style="width: 356px; height: 640px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perch rotation - 270 degrees, spins the bird around (not shown)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lean - +20, -20 degrees, to lean forward and backward at the point
where the legs connect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Head yaw - +45, -45 degrees back and forth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Head tilt - +15, -15 degrees up and down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beak - 30 degrees, could be all open or all closed (shown in the
diagram as 15 degrees)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking that after I constructed the foam version, I could figure
things out from there, but after seeing&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hackaday.com/2013/02/28/3d-printed-hog-drive/"&gt;this post on Hack-A-Day with
a &amp;quot;HOG Drive&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;,
I realized I could leverage off of this design for the head linkages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chatted with Skip at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/"&gt;Interlock&lt;/a&gt;, and
by the end of this last Tuesday evening, I had two 3-D printed versions
of this, using ABS, rather than the PLA material I am
more&amp;nbsp;familiar&amp;nbsp;with. (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:52097"&gt;Here's the Thingiverse link for the
design&lt;/a&gt;.) Since I wasn't
going to be mounting a motor, we (and by &amp;quot;we&amp;quot; I mean &amp;quot;he&amp;quot;) replaced the
motor space with a flat plate with a mounting screw hole. &amp;nbsp;He also
replaced the back control arm with just a peg, since the bridge-like
shape wouldn't hold up properly on his printer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that I've had to do for my re-purposing of the DB15
Stepper Motor controllers is to be able to reliably reprogram them. &amp;nbsp;The
early versions of the programmer consisted of just a wire harness with a
DB-15 connector on one end, and leads that plugged into the headers on a
standard Arduino board. It eventually progressed into an octopus-like
wire harness that used another DB15 as the &amp;quot;host&amp;quot; Arduino. &amp;nbsp;This worked
well, but is cumbersome. &amp;nbsp;In this post, I'll highlight the basic circuit
used, and the procedure for using it, specifically for this controller
board, but the techniques are applicable to other ATmega based micros as
well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZCQSK2Hy--o/USuXT0QgurI/AAAAAAAACT0/1nTzDp29MIM/s1600/2013-02-12+23.39.41.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZCQSK2Hy--o/USuXT0QgurI/AAAAAAAACT0/1nTzDp29MIM/s640/2013-02-12+23.39.41.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The reason for doing all of this work. &amp;nbsp;About 30 or so DB-15 widgets
which can be repurposed as Arduino-compatible microcontroller boards.
&amp;nbsp;They don't have all of the IO that a stock Arduino board has, but if
your device only needs 6 IO (one of which is analog input), with a
potential for another analog input, and 4 more digital outputs with a
little work, they're an excellent free resource at Interlock!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICSP (In-Circuit Serial Programmer) is basically a device that takes
in a firmware image from a host computer, and uses SPI-based
communications with a target device to shove that firmware image into
place. &amp;nbsp;For general Arduino use, you can shove the Arduino serial
bootloader into place. This is about 1k (for the optimized bootloader
aka &amp;quot;Optiboot&amp;quot;) of program space that sits on your micro, next to any
sketch that you download to it. &amp;nbsp;When the Arduino powers up or gets
reset, this small bit of code will check for a new sketch to download.
&amp;nbsp;If it sees something, it will accept it, shove it into program memory
and then run it. &amp;nbsp;If it doesn't, it simply skips over and runs whatever
sketch has already been downloaded there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICSP allows you to program in that bootloader. &amp;nbsp;You can also use it
to program in your sketch, if you need to reclaim that 1kbyte of space.
&amp;nbsp;I'll get into that later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. &amp;nbsp;Let's get into the hardware for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gbxvXGpxJGY/US4q8noQw7I/AAAAAAAACVM/4EcaBPf7WnM/s1600/ArduinoProgrammingHost.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gbxvXGpxJGY/US4q8noQw7I/AAAAAAAACVM/4EcaBPf7WnM/s640/ArduinoProgrammingHost.png" style="width: 616px; height: 640px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Host Connection.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Showing the basic construction for the Arduino-ICSP Host.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wmhtPuM5Y4E/US4q8oSWMVI/AAAAAAAACVE/5d9VSEvJBTY/s1600/D15_To_ArduinoProgrammer.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wmhtPuM5Y4E/US4q8oSWMVI/AAAAAAAACVE/5d9VSEvJBTY/s1600/D15_To_ArduinoProgrammer.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Target connection.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Showing how to hook up the D15 to the programming header above. &amp;nbsp;These
6 lines can also be arranged in the 2x3 layout standard on Arduino
boards as well, or wired directly to ATMega chips for other
applications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Arduino, the pins are mapped as such:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Digital 13: SCLK (Orange)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Digital 12: MISO (Yellow)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Digital 11: MOSI (Violet)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Digital 10: SS (Green) (Wired to RESET for the programmer, DB15 pin
4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The circuit to wire up is pretty easy. &amp;nbsp;On the host, there are three
status LEDs that the packed-in &amp;quot;ArduinoISP&amp;quot; uses. &amp;nbsp;Heartbeat shows you
it's alive, Programming shows you when it's programming a target device,
and Error tells you when something went wrong -- which is also displayed
on the host computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three output should be wired through a 220 ohm resistor, to a LED,
and tied to ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other thing that may be necessary is to disable the reset circuit on
the host Arduino. &amp;nbsp;This is necessary because when the computer connects
to the host Arduino-programmer, that micro will reset, and then quickly
hop into the &amp;quot;check for new firmware over serial for itself&amp;quot; routine, as
explained above. &amp;nbsp;This may often cause failures with the host computer
connecting and communicating with the programmer properly. &amp;nbsp;If you
disable the reset circuit here, it will never fall into this state, and
will remain perfectly stable. &amp;nbsp;The easiest way to disable it, if you're
building it up from scratch, is to disconnect the DTR/Serial based reset
trigger completely, leaving the 10k pullup resistor tied to the
arduino's reset line. &amp;nbsp;However, if you're using a pre-constructed
Arduino as the host, you can simply tie the reset line to +5v through a
120 ohm resistor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connecting the host to the target is also easy. &amp;nbsp;The target device
should be hooked up as a basic arduino -- power, crystal clock, etc. Be
sure that even if they're on separate power supplies, that they at least
have their grounds tied together. &amp;nbsp;For ease of use, just power the
target from the host completely. Past that, simply connect up pins 11,
12, 13 from the host to the target device. &amp;nbsp;This will put both on the
same SPI bus. &amp;nbsp;This is how the data will get sent to the target device.
&amp;nbsp;Basically, this maps out as SPI-MISO, SPI-MOSI, and SPI-CLOCK. &amp;nbsp;The
only other connection you need to do is to hook up pin 10 from the host
computer through to the RESET line of the target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PccHS7Y3pE0/USuU0C6kxoI/AAAAAAAACTA/Etr9RQxqWjU/s1600/2013-01-29+21.44.56.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image4" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PccHS7Y3pE0/USuU0C6kxoI/AAAAAAAACTA/Etr9RQxqWjU/s640/2013-01-29+21.44.56.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Step 1: hook up power, ground, serial IO, and reset circuitry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The reset circuit is a 10k pullup resistor to +5v, and a .1uF cap to
the reset line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Next up will be putting a jumper to disable the reset line as explained
above.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Note: this picture is from a different build but shows the same first
step)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DB15 as seen here has pin 1 on the right. &amp;nbsp;The pins are basically:
1) TX, &amp;nbsp;2) RX, 4) RESET, then +5 and ground on the bottom pins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fjVnBhiYZlg/USuVpGsBK0I/AAAAAAAACTU/wsZe01vZQBY/s1600/2013-02-12+23.42.15.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image5" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fjVnBhiYZlg/USuVpGsBK0I/AAAAAAAACTU/wsZe01vZQBY/s640/2013-02-12+23.42.15.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Red LED is the power indicator. &amp;nbsp;The resistor and cap for the reset
circuit are visible, as is the jumper for disabling reset on the ICSP
widget.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above you can see the version of this board that I fabbed up for
Interlock. &amp;nbsp;It has the FTDI header for connecting to the host computer,
and used a pre-programmed DB-15 widget with the ICSP firmware on it. &amp;nbsp;I
know this sounds like a chicken-and-egg thing, but once you program your
first device using a standard Arduino as the host, it makes sense to
program one of these, and use it to replace that board &amp;nbsp;instead.
(especially when you have ~100 of them to spare. hehe)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blue/white/red/white lines from the ICSP widget are equivalent to
pins 10,11,12,13 on a standard host Arduino, and those go right into the
cable down to the target device. Since pins 9, 8, and 7 were not all
able to be broken out to the LEDs, I had to tweak the sketch a little.
&amp;nbsp;8 is the LED on the ICSP widget itself, which is Yellow. &amp;nbsp;The Yellow
and Green LEDs on the board (along with their current limiting
resistors) are wired up to Analog 2 and Digital 3 (pwm), and these ports
are changed accordingly. &amp;nbsp;8 remains as the error LED, 3 became the green
Heartbeat light, and A2 became the new yellow program light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DFLaZBRh8c4/USuVmPnRu_I/AAAAAAAACTI/iwscZJc6a2U/s1600/2013-02-12+23.40.30.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image6" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DFLaZBRh8c4/USuVmPnRu_I/AAAAAAAACTI/iwscZJc6a2U/s640/2013-02-12+23.40.30.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ready to roll, with a target device plugged in!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note the extra prototyping area. &amp;nbsp;This can be for a ZIF socket in the
future for other devices, etc.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BpRtrMBwj4c/US4q8gyfdSI/AAAAAAAACVI/E2sdLVU5ky0/s1600/D15_to_D15_Programmer.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image7" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BpRtrMBwj4c/US4q8gyfdSI/AAAAAAAACVI/E2sdLVU5ky0/s640/D15_to_D15_Programmer.png" style="width: 570px; height: 640px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The full circuit diagram for the D15-hosted programmer, connected to a
D15 target.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(The wire colors are the same as the above for reference.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this is all wired up, we can get some firmware down onto that
thing. &amp;nbsp;In our case, we have a device that isn't directly supported by
the Arduino IDE, so we need to configure that first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two things need to be installed. First is the board definition, second
is the optiboot hex file. Both of these content files can be grabbed
from my&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/BleuLlama/GeodesicSphere/tree/master/Projects/DB15Arduino"&gt;Geodesic Sphere
repository&lt;/a&gt;.
&amp;nbsp;Full instructions are also there as for specific directories on Windows
and Mac for doing this installation. The &amp;quot;readme&amp;quot; there shows the text
block to drop into your &amp;quot;Boards.txt&amp;quot; file, and where to find that file.
&amp;nbsp;You will also need to drop the optiboot.hex file into the &amp;quot;optiboot&amp;quot;
folder as well. &amp;nbsp;Once these two steps are done, you can start up the
Arduino IDE and you're ready to program. &amp;nbsp;Let's also assume that we've
already externally kickstarted this, and the &amp;quot;Arduino ISP&amp;quot; sketch is
already on the host device, and is running properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's where it gets confusing. &amp;nbsp;What? You're not already confused?
&amp;nbsp;HERE WE GO!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fire up the Arduino IDE, and let's set it for the D15 device. &amp;nbsp;From the
&amp;quot;Tools&amp;quot; menu, select &amp;quot;Serial Port&amp;quot; and select your FTDI interface's
serial port name. &amp;nbsp;Next, from the &amp;quot;Tools&amp;quot; menu, select &amp;quot;ATmega168 at
7372800Hz (D15)&amp;quot; from the &amp;quot;Board&amp;quot; menu. &amp;nbsp;This will tell the IDE what our
target device is. &amp;nbsp;Now, from the &amp;quot;Tools&amp;quot; menu, select &amp;quot;Arduino as ISP&amp;quot;
from the &amp;quot;Programmer&amp;quot; menu. This is all one-time configuration stuff.
&amp;nbsp;Now, you can plug in a target D15 widget to the end of the cable seen
above, and then select &amp;quot;Burn Bootloader&amp;quot; from the &amp;quot;Tools&amp;quot; menu. &amp;nbsp;A bunch
of lights should flash, and you'll end up with the Arduino bootloader on
the target widget!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the above setup, it's wired such that you can also use it to test the
target. &amp;nbsp;Disconnect the FTDI cable, disconnect the ICSP widget, and move
the newly programmed device into the DB15 connector on the board.
&amp;nbsp;Adjust the jumper so that &amp;quot;RESET&amp;quot; is enabled. &amp;nbsp;Now plug the DB15 cable
back in. &amp;nbsp;This is now the equivalent to using the DB15 as a barebones
Arduino. &amp;nbsp;Load up the D15_Test sketch included in the github repository
mentioned above. &amp;nbsp;Click the &amp;quot;upload&amp;quot; arrow button, wait a moment, and
the LED on the target widget should be blinking. &amp;nbsp;That's it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One alternate way you can use this is to program your Arduino code onto
the target widget without installing the bootloader. &amp;nbsp;These widgets use
an ATMega 168, which has very constrained space, so this might be
preferred for larger programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hook it back up in the programmer configuration, with the ICSP widget on
the board, the target on the cable, and the jumper set to disable RESET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Arduino IDE, instead of just clicking the &amp;quot;upload&amp;quot; arrow
button, hold down the [SHIFT] key, and the text will change from
&amp;quot;upload&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;upload using programmer&amp;quot;. &amp;nbsp;It may take a moment longer, but
the end result is that you will see the LED blinking on the target
widget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use this to program other Arduino-like devices too (ATMega,
ATTiny, etc). &amp;nbsp;You will just need to breakout the 6 lines (MOSI, MISO,
CLOCK, RESET, +5v, GROUND) to whatever pin header configuration or
socket is necessary. &amp;nbsp;Then you can just select the target device from
the menu as appropriate (ATmega 168, 328, 5v, 3.3v, etc) and then select
&amp;quot;Burn Bootloader&amp;quot; from the menus as above, and it will put the
appropriate serial bootloader onto the device for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seen in a previous post, I have a Tron Mini/Cabaret arcade machine.
&amp;nbsp;I used to have a Tron full-sized (FS) machine, but sold it many years
ago. &amp;nbsp;One thing that the FS had over the mini was lots of extra
lighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seen in a previous post, I have a Tron Mini/Cabaret arcade machine.
&amp;nbsp;I used to have a Tron full-sized (FS) machine, but sold it many years

&lt;p&gt;It had artwork beyond the monitor lit with a regular light, it had a
blacklight above the control panel to make the traces glow, and make the
joystick glow. &amp;nbsp;There's also a second blacklight below the control panel
to backlight the bottom portion as well. &amp;nbsp;All of these lights are always
lit, making the machine extra awesome. &amp;nbsp;On the mini, there is glow
artwork, but no light to illuminate them. &amp;nbsp;Ever since the late 90s, I've
had a plan to change this, so I bought a pack of UV LEDs, but they've
sat dormant in my parts bin until now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3PQ37GAflKU/UQllX60VInI/AAAAAAAACRs/6bSx7ymUibk/s1600/91b64d71ed8b3555b56265edc340dccf.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3PQ37GAflKU/UQllX60VInI/AAAAAAAACRs/6bSx7ymUibk/s640/91b64d71ed8b3555b56265edc340dccf.jpg" style="width: 546px; height: 640px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that I'd like to bring to this, is to go an extra step, and
bring some ideas over from the &amp;quot;Environmental Discs Of Tron&amp;quot; (EDOT)
machine. &amp;nbsp;On the EDOT, you walk inside of it... one of the few, if not
the only, games where you can do this. &amp;nbsp;Around the monitor and control
panel are lights, similar to the FS Tron. However, on EDOT, they're
controlled by the game. &amp;nbsp;They will flash and such when certain game
events happen. I can make this happen with Tron, using an interface to
the game, and a ROM hack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above all, the modifications made&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;must be reversible without any
damage to the machine&lt;/strong&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I do not want to inflict any permanent damage
or changes to the cabinet. &amp;nbsp;I will simply add lighting, make a ROM hack
to control the lights, and mount an additional board inside the cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-alUmFfgO7IU/UQllj55GK0I/AAAAAAAACR0/9DRz_vTT-7Y/s1600/2013-01-29+21.45.04.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-alUmFfgO7IU/UQllj55GK0I/AAAAAAAACR0/9DRz_vTT-7Y/s640/2013-01-29+21.45.04.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start with, I need a secondary micro to control the lights. I'll use
one of my stepper motor controller/Arduino devices. I made the FTDI
programming and power interface seen above in about 30 minutes on the
piece of strip board at Interlock this past Tuesday. &amp;nbsp;You can see the
resistor/capacitor pair to handle the programmer's reset, power, and
TX/RX lines, and a red power indicator LED for the heck of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IZXdgylhkJM/UQlmBOhEWjI/AAAAAAAACR8/tgu_9wa8Lcw/s1600/2013-01-29+23.37.25.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image4" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IZXdgylhkJM/UQlmBOhEWjI/AAAAAAAACR8/tgu_9wa8Lcw/s640/2013-01-29+23.37.25.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit more work, I had the 3 LED driver chips wired up, with their
8 outputs, along with the 5 pin header which I'll be using to interface
it with the arcade machine. &amp;nbsp;The pinout there is two bits of input, 5v
power input, and ground. &amp;nbsp;I'll add in SPI-like (clock+data)
communications from the TRON game. &amp;nbsp;I figure that the first version will
just send down a packet stating the lighting effect, but in the future I
can use this to send down high scores as well, which can be sent out via
serial to a host PC and post them on the net or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first it didn't power on properly, and the LED driver chips got VERY
hot. &amp;nbsp;Then I remembered that the circuit diagram I was referring to
while soldering this up was incorrect and had power and ground reversed
to the chip. &amp;nbsp;I also had + and - wired backwards for the LEDs as well. I
forgot that these driver chips sink current, rather than sourcing it.
&amp;nbsp;After a little bit of emergency soldering, all of that got worked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BAv4m00YYho/UQlnQYvBDNI/AAAAAAAACSE/KIVSIgF94PA/s1600/2013-01-30+00.07.36.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image5" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BAv4m00YYho/UQlnQYvBDNI/AAAAAAAACSE/KIVSIgF94PA/s640/2013-01-30+00.07.36.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I've since cleaned up the wiring a bit, adding some insulation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to wire up the LEDs such that the current limiting resistor
was wired up with the LEDs, rather than on the main board. &amp;nbsp;I'm glad I
did this, as the resistance I picked (220 ohms) was way too high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YhLD_7PXFZI/UQlnzncUnXI/AAAAAAAACSU/RoJJSDb4td4/s1600/2013-01-30+01.39.00.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image6" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YhLD_7PXFZI/UQlnzncUnXI/AAAAAAAACSU/RoJJSDb4td4/s640/2013-01-30+01.39.00.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enhanced image. It sadly doesn't look quite this intense in person.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oE-ZamW4Z-Y/UQloCRkoH5I/AAAAAAAACSc/pEc8tMDBtXE/s1600/2013-01-30+01.40.49.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image7" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oE-ZamW4Z-Y/UQloCRkoH5I/AAAAAAAACSc/pEc8tMDBtXE/s640/2013-01-30+01.40.49.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Experimenting with how it will look to have LEDs inside of the joystick
to illuminate it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output from these LEDs was much dimmer than I was hoping for. I will
be experimenting with lower-valued resistors, as well as possibly
doubling-up LEDs for lighting the various artwork elements. &amp;nbsp;I also need
to figure out how to mount the LEDs without damaging the machine at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up is the ROM hack to talk with this!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm in the process of constructing/setting up my office in the house,
and for lighting, I have decided that I want to use xmas light-style
lighting. &amp;nbsp;Many years ago, I used to light my room with

&lt;p&gt;I'm in the process of constructing/setting up my office in the house,
and for lighting, I have decided that I want to use xmas light-style
lighting. &amp;nbsp;Many years ago, I used to light my room with
multicolored&amp;nbsp;incandescent&amp;nbsp;lights. I loved the warm indirect glow, and
smooth light without a single light source. &amp;nbsp;This time, I'm going to
take it a step further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there's nothing about this project yet that is really innovative
over what others have done, it is the first step to getting the office
lighting done. &amp;nbsp;The real fun will come into play once I'm able to hang
this up, and start programming effects, and tying those effects in to
physical or time-based events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple years back I picked up a strand of addressable LED lights,
similar to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://adafruit.com/products/322"&gt;this one, available at
adafruit.com&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I got a strand of
50 lights, blew out one of them while being stupid, and used a few of
them in Jasper's Toy Box (posts to come about that eventually), so I'm
left with 42 lights. &amp;nbsp;A nice number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any event, the plan is to hang them up around the upper perimeter of
the room, and it will give a nice comfortable glow to illuminate the
room. &amp;nbsp;I can also extend it by doing lighting effects with the color.
&amp;nbsp;For example, in the evening I can have all of them dim blue, and
randomly twinkle one to white, to simulate a star in the sky. &amp;nbsp;I could
also tie them in to an automation system to glow a particular corner of
the room red or yellow when i have email from a specific person. &amp;nbsp;I
could also adjust their color based on the content of my monitor, or the
light outisde, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic design for the control circuitry is that there will be
an&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://arduino.cc/"&gt;Arduino-based&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;AVR micro (actually&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://geodesicsphere.blogspot.com/2012/11/reverse-engineering-stepper-motor_5.html"&gt;one of
the D-15 servo controllers I've
appropriated&lt;/a&gt;),
which is perfect, since the strands only need two lines to control them.
&amp;nbsp;The host computer will send down codes to address the LEDs (set all to
color X, set led Y to color X, etc) and this will pass on the content to
the strand, and twiddle the data lines and all of that fun stuff. &amp;nbsp;I had
considered putting more &amp;quot;smarts&amp;quot; into the micro, but the amount of space
in there would severely limit the kind of content I could &amp;quot;display&amp;quot;, so
I decided to put all of the grunt work back on the host computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uM2j8G4bmkI/UQAByR5gu9I/AAAAAAAACMs/VDXCsItz4Y8/s1600/2013-01-22+20.57.51.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uM2j8G4bmkI/UQAByR5gu9I/AAAAAAAACMs/VDXCsItz4Y8/s640/2013-01-22+20.57.51.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To power it, I needed to get a 5 volt power supply. I snagged a power
brick from an old external drive case, as well as a standard PC power
connector, from a failed power supply, and spliced the two of them
together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0Lk4XPmclbQ/UQAB5hIWmkI/AAAAAAAACM0/kjh75lnZnPI/s1600/2013-01-22+21.08.04.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="aligncenter" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0Lk4XPmclbQ/UQAB5hIWmkI/AAAAAAAACM0/kjh75lnZnPI/s640/2013-01-22+21.08.04.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 454px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copious, yet appropriate amounts of heat shrink tubing and splicing some
wires yielded a nice power supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qRuJm5PwJS8/UQACEt5W8LI/AAAAAAAACM8/DRBHdWGILGk/s1600/2013-01-22+22.17.59.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qRuJm5PwJS8/UQACEt5W8LI/AAAAAAAACM8/DRBHdWGILGk/s640/2013-01-22+22.17.59.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I built an interface board to tie it all together. &amp;nbsp;The ports on
the board are (left to right) - 6 pin FTDI interface for serial IO, 2
pin jumper (power the D15 from the power supply rather than FTDI
source), 3 pin power, 4 pin light strand connector. &amp;nbsp;You can also see in
this picture, the process of crimping the terminals for the molex
connector on the LED strand's wires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept the layout and pinout of the FTDI the same as I used for&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://geodesicsphere.blogspot.com/2012/12/prototype-elias-serial-network-node.html"&gt;my
serial node
experiment&lt;/a&gt;.
&amp;nbsp;This will help me plug that connector in correctly. &amp;nbsp;I&amp;nbsp;still&amp;nbsp;need to
add visual cues (colored sharpie markings) to help me align the pins
correctly. &amp;nbsp;The power connector has GND on pins 1 and 3, and +5V on pin
2. &amp;nbsp;Keeping it symmetrical will help me always plug it in correctly,
reducing the chance that I will blow it all up. &amp;nbsp;The 4 pin connector is
the same pinout as the wiring of the LEDs. &amp;nbsp;GND, Data, Clock, +5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sn6v9P3L0Ck/UQDMlTmqFZI/AAAAAAAACOk/auhjvIBC_9w/s1600/2013-01-24+00.12.35.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image4" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sn6v9P3L0Ck/UQDMlTmqFZI/AAAAAAAACOk/auhjvIBC_9w/s640/2013-01-24+00.12.35.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jumper on the board (dis)connects the power header from the D15 and
FTDI portion. &amp;nbsp;If I make standalone firmware for it, I can power
everything from the power supply, if need be. The tiny green LED on the
board just lights when the D15 has power. &amp;nbsp;A nice indicator in case
everything else is not functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protocol I used for this is very simple. &amp;nbsp;There's a command
character sent through serial, then the data for that command. &amp;nbsp;If the
firmware is expecting a command character but gets something it doesn't
understand, it just keeps checking the serial input for a command it
knows. &amp;nbsp;The protocol is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;p&amp;lt;index of LED&amp;gt;&amp;lt;red value&amp;gt;&amp;lt;green value&amp;gt;&amp;lt;blue value&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five bytes. &amp;nbsp;It sets the specified LED (0..42 in this case) with the
specified RGB value (0..255 each). &amp;nbsp;Note that this is not an ascii
string, it is data. &amp;nbsp;So no matter what, it is 5 bytes to change a single
pixel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;f&amp;lt;red value&amp;gt;&amp;lt;green value&amp;gt;&amp;lt;blue value&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Force all of the lights to the specified color. &amp;nbsp;This is handy for
clearing everything to black, or flashing/fading effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/BleuLlama/GeodesicSphere/tree/master/Projects/AddressableLEDStrip"&gt;Here's the Arduino firmware used to handle all of
this&lt;/a&gt;:
&amp;nbsp;(Note: it requires that the strand's library be installed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hvlLzR8S3ew/UQAGvMGSVII/AAAAAAAACNc/H5LFUVdgCZ0/s1600/2013-01-23++1.27.57+AM.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image5" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hvlLzR8S3ew/UQAGvMGSVII/AAAAAAAACNc/H5LFUVdgCZ0/s400/2013-01-23++1.27.57+AM.png" style="width: 400px; height: 358px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, that's it. &amp;nbsp;I made&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/BleuLlama/GeodesicSphere/tree/master/Projects/AddressableLEDStrip"&gt;a simple interface on the desktop side in
Processing&lt;/a&gt;,
adapted from&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://geodesicsphere.blogspot.com/2012/10/a-computer-controllable-pixel.html"&gt;my previous controllable pixel
software&lt;/a&gt;,
to let me click and change the color of an LED. I also added some key

&lt;p&gt;I won't lie to you. &amp;nbsp;Having an arcade machine is a lot of fun. &amp;nbsp;I used
to have about 6 of them, but I'm down to two, due to space restrictions
and general sanity. &amp;nbsp;The two that I still have are a TRON Mini/Cabaret,
and a generic full-size cabinet …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MTbnJ9YpTcg/UPbXP5-Qt9I/AAAAAAAACLs/btDXSoM82CI/s1600/2013-01-15+23.57.19.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" class="aligncenter" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MTbnJ9YpTcg/UPbXP5-Qt9I/AAAAAAAACLs/btDXSoM82CI/s640/2013-01-15+23.57.19.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't lie to you. &amp;nbsp;Having an arcade machine is a lot of fun. &amp;nbsp;I used
to have about 6 of them, but I'm down to two, due to space restrictions
and general sanity. &amp;nbsp;The two that I still have are a TRON Mini/Cabaret,
and a generic full-size cabinet into which I can put one of a few game
motherboards that I have. (Dig Dug, Mortal Kombat, Klax, Rampart, and a
few others.) &amp;nbsp;But one of the less&amp;nbsp;glamorous&amp;nbsp;sides of collecting machines
is troubleshooting and repairing these 30 year old beasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought the Tron Mini in the late 90s as an empty cabinet. &amp;nbsp;I was
having a difficult time back then finding an affordable Tron
board/control set to install, so I instead put Satan's Hollow into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ts-AO60eYo8/UPbSm_i9GtI/AAAAAAAACKo/IF8KBNpNU80/s1600/20001107_0011.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ts-AO60eYo8/UPbSm_i9GtI/AAAAAAAACKo/IF8KBNpNU80/s400/20001107_0011.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tron Cabaret cabinet with Satan's Hollow - Note the red joystick and
white &amp;quot;shield&amp;quot; button instead of the standard blue stick and spinner
from Tron.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, I found all of the parts needed including a few tricks to
restore this. &amp;nbsp;When I put the Satan's Hollow boardset in, I
rewired/hacked/brutalized the wiring in the cabinet to&amp;nbsp;accommodate&amp;nbsp;SH.
&amp;nbsp;Although SH used the same boardset, the controls were wired
differently. &amp;nbsp;Once I got the Tron board, and realized how rare this
machine really is, I re-wired it using a wire harness from a junked Tron
machine. &amp;nbsp;I also found the correct power supply to install, repaired by
a fellow collector. &amp;nbsp;The controls were also out of another junked
machine. &amp;nbsp;Over time, I got the machine as restored as I could get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tron uses a boardset, three boards connected together, from Bally/Midway
called &amp;quot;MCR-2&amp;quot;. &amp;nbsp;It consists of a CPU/Program board, a Video/Graphics
board, and a Sound/IO board. &amp;nbsp;Midway used this boardset for a few games,
including Tron, Satan's Hollow, Two Tigers, and a couple other ones. &amp;nbsp;If
you have a ROM programmer (which I do), you can buy one of the cheaper
boardsets to use as a replacement for one of the more desirable
machines. &amp;nbsp;Tron boardsets, when I was last looking, sold for about
$75-$150. &amp;nbsp;Two Tigers sold for about $40. &amp;nbsp;The boardset I have Tron
running on right now is a Two Tigers boardset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When restoring a game, there's a line to walk with respect to what parts
to put into it. &amp;nbsp;This machine has some vinyl veneer on the sides, which
are somewhat damaged. &amp;nbsp;It also has a fair bit of wear on the front edge
of the control panel. &amp;nbsp;I could have tracked down a
replacement/reproduction for these parts, but I'd rather keep it factory
original. &amp;nbsp;It's not like the damage is too severe for either issue. &amp;nbsp;I'm
actually very happy with the overall condition.... &amp;nbsp;except for the
monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cabaret/mini cabinet uses a 13&amp;quot; monitor, compared with the
full-size's 19&amp;quot; monitor. &amp;nbsp;The monitor on this one showed a wavy haze,
distorting the image a little, and mucking with the brightness across
the screen, which &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YytR8kJBrPw"&gt;you can kinda see in this
video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was given a solution&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.umlautllama.com/Image/2001/01/cap/"&gt;about 11 years
ago&lt;/a&gt;, involving
modifying one of the boards in the monitor (the &amp;quot;neck board&amp;quot;, which
connects directly to the back of the picture tube) but never did it, and
lost the parts a few years ago. &amp;nbsp;I instead&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amusementsplus.com/"&gt;bought a &amp;quot;cap kit&amp;quot; from
Amusements Plus&amp;nbsp;around 3 years ago&lt;/a&gt;,
and decided to&amp;nbsp;install&amp;nbsp;it. &amp;nbsp;The last time I did one of these was in
2001, so it's been some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kD3CON3lFA0/UPbVkLIgBJI/AAAAAAAACLM/IOI-CpSvJ34/s1600/2013-01-15+21.24.08.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kD3CON3lFA0/UPbVkLIgBJI/AAAAAAAACLM/IOI-CpSvJ34/s640/2013-01-15+21.24.08.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 476px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Love that desoldering iron! &amp;nbsp;The pump just clears out all of the solder
super fast!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gcGkwIIbCms/UPbVvRPQguI/AAAAAAAACLU/5TOutBy7rnc/s1600/2013-01-15+22.08.33.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gcGkwIIbCms/UPbVvRPQguI/AAAAAAAACLU/5TOutBy7rnc/s640/2013-01-15+22.08.33.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of the caps in the cap kit have been replaced. &amp;nbsp;Shiny new caps on
the board. &amp;nbsp;Old, dusty, puffy caps in the plastic bag. &amp;nbsp;I'm not entirely
sure why I kept them...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the awesome desoldering tool
at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/"&gt;Interlock&lt;/a&gt;, I was able to do this in
about 45 minutes, rather than the 3 hours it took me years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9CZk6B8II_g/UPbWLVXCodI/AAAAAAAACLc/lNHRuaus464/s1600/2013-01-15+23.41.43.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image4" class="aligncenter" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9CZk6B8II_g/UPbWLVXCodI/AAAAAAAACLc/lNHRuaus464/s640/2013-01-15+23.41.43.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The board is mounted into the monitor framework, and reconnected to the
picture tube.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;|image5|&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kOw2tsVd-hY/UPbXzemPFaI/AAAAAAAACMA/cexxzopC0Ms/s1600/2013-01-16+01.11.27.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image6" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kOw2tsVd-hY/UPbXzemPFaI/AAAAAAAACMA/cexxzopC0Ms/s320/2013-01-16+01.11.27.jpg" style="width: 239px; height: 320px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just about all of these knobs needed to be tweaked to get the picture
looking its best!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some calibration of adjusting all of the controls (focus and drive
on the flyback transformer, and R/G/B Drive and Cutoffs on the neck
board), the picture looked better than it has ever looked before! Which
you can't really tell from these pictures, but trust me, the picture is
sharp, colors bright, and the imagery is stable. It's like it's a new
monitor!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JX1z847H4jI/UPbW4VBYEjI/AAAAAAAACLk/dupw1sy-okw/s1600/2013-01-15+23.49.41.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image7" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JX1z847H4jI/UPbW4VBYEjI/AAAAAAAACLk/dupw1sy-okw/s640/2013-01-15+23.49.41.jpg" style="width: 478px; height: 640px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The boardset I had in it at first was the Satan's Hollow with my ROM
hack so that it will work as a drop-in for TRON arcade cabinets with no
rewiring at all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-C9tTnXwNreQ/UPbXP5ca0vI/AAAAAAAACLw/4Fskp5j7TB0/s1600/2013-01-16+00.15.21.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image8" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-C9tTnXwNreQ/UPbXP5ca0vI/AAAAAAAACLw/4Fskp5j7TB0/s640/2013-01-16+00.15.21.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yeah, a horrible high score, but just let me practice and
remember&amp;nbsp;`my old
strategies &amp;lt;http://www.csh.rit.edu/~jerry/arcade/tron/&amp;gt;`__!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The above pictures were taken before I realized how much dust had
accumulated on the picture tube and shroud. &amp;nbsp;I've since removed the
artwork glass as well as the tinted plexi below that, and cleaned off
those items as well as the picture tube itself. &amp;nbsp;That eliminated all of
the haze, and improved the picture as well!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, I'll get 30 more years of life out of if!&lt;/p&gt;

rather than having one single project, or a part of a larger project to
work on, I have a bunch of little things I want to get done. &amp;nbsp;They have
the tools and materials I often need to do this. &amp;nbsp;This past Tuesday was
one such night. &amp;nbsp;I had four things I wanted to work on, and I got all
four done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NLnCYmL7t80/UMn5JF24vxI/AAAAAAAACFc/TPBXZ5fvRU4/s1600/2012-12-11+20.47.28.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NLnCYmL7t80/UMn5JF24vxI/AAAAAAAACFc/TPBXZ5fvRU4/s400/2012-12-11+20.47.28.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 298px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:&lt;/strong&gt; I like to put handles on things. &amp;nbsp;My favorite handles are from
Lowes or Home Depot, and are called &amp;quot;wire drawer pulls&amp;quot; as seen in the
image above. &amp;nbsp;They're relatively inexpensive at about $2, and are simple
to install. &amp;nbsp;Generally they would be put on drawers in a modern kitchen
or a clinical-type setting, but I like to put them on everything. &amp;nbsp;If
something is portable, it should have a handle. &amp;nbsp;I just drilled two
small holes in the plastic parts bin seen above, shoved the screws in
from behind with some washers, and done! &amp;nbsp;I've used these handles for
portable drive carriers, and other now-more-portable things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-A2jqRHKGfyg/UMn5KGoxLGI/AAAAAAAACFk/H8Gbj2G43sA/s1600/2012-12-11+20.56.15.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-A2jqRHKGfyg/UMn5KGoxLGI/AAAAAAAACFk/H8Gbj2G43sA/s400/2012-12-11+20.56.15.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 298px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2:&lt;/strong&gt; My son, Jasper sometimes breaks his toys. &amp;nbsp;I usually am the one
who fixes them. &amp;nbsp;Above are two wood bolts from his workbench. &amp;nbsp;The
threaded screws came out of the bolt heads. &amp;nbsp;I just scraped out the glue
from the holes, and cleaned up both sides with a rasp and some other
things that probably weren't designed for such things. &amp;nbsp;I added some
wood glue, threw them in these clamps, and returned the screws to Jasper
in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3:&lt;/strong&gt; I had tried to fix my DLP projector a few weeks back. &amp;nbsp;There was
something in the light path making half of the image dim such that if
you shook the projector, it would clear up a little. I tore it down, and
right between the spinny color wheel and the mirrors in front of the DLP
chip is this little mirror tube collimator. The glue holding the four
front-surface mirrors to the rectangular metal box had failed, and the
mirrors became loose. &amp;nbsp;A couple weeks back, I had tried gluing it back
together with epoxy, and it seemed to work, but a new, harsher shadow
was in the projected image. &amp;nbsp;I needed to get some dental tools, mainly
the little mirror tool, to see what was going on. &amp;nbsp;Sure enough, this
little guy was aligned incorrectly. &amp;nbsp;A bunch of futzing with it later,
and it is now fully functional!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5MijzfBd0PI/UMn5MEb4yBI/AAAAAAAACF0/1B7dWXEbXxI/s1600/2012-12-11+22.57.53.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image5" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5MijzfBd0PI/UMn5MEb4yBI/AAAAAAAACF0/1B7dWXEbXxI/s400/2012-12-11+22.57.53.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 298px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4:&lt;/strong&gt; I have been building little breakout boards for my stepper motor
controller-turned-arduino boards. &amp;nbsp;I decided that for the animatronic
bird project, I wanted to have a way to input joystick data. &amp;nbsp;I made a
small adapter to go from PC Gameport Joystick to the widget.&amp;nbsp;`&amp;nbsp;I
followed this project
here &amp;lt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.built-to-spec.com/blog/2009/09/10/using-a-pc-joystick-with-the-arduino/"&gt;http://www.built-to-spec.com/blog/2009/09/10/using-a-pc-joystick-with-the-arduino/&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;`__&amp;nbsp;for
the correct circuit -- basically just some pullups on the digital button
inputs, and some pulldowns for the analog axis inputs. &amp;nbsp;I only wired up
the first X/Y pair as the widgets only have two analog inputs available.
&amp;nbsp;It was relatively simple to build. &amp;nbsp;I had built the main breakout board
the night before at home, and i made the orange-wire to Gameport
connector cable at Interlock. &amp;nbsp;With help from Nick, providing the old
joystick, before I left i had written an auto-scaling display of the
current joystick state. &amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;More about this to come in future posts&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, it was a densely packed evening, with four mini-projects
completed. &amp;nbsp;Huzzah!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic design I'm going with for the vacuum plate/box&amp;nbsp;is a small box,
with a shopvac connector on the bottom, pegboard as the top, screwed
together, and metal foil taped to seal air gaps. &amp;nbsp;This is sort of a
mixture of a few different designs&amp;nbsp;I've&amp;nbsp;found on the net. &amp;nbsp;The material
will go on its own frame, heated by a heat gun, then pushed down onto
the vacuum frame, with the shop vac turned on. &amp;nbsp;The softened material
will get sucked in tight against the mold, forming it into that shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hbkJ1mtbEcs/UL-_Wgg1u4I/AAAAAAAACC0/xerinbr9PXs/s1600/IMG_1964.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hbkJ1mtbEcs/UL-_Wgg1u4I/AAAAAAAACC0/xerinbr9PXs/s400/IMG_1964.JPG" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic frame is 12&amp;quot; square. &amp;nbsp;I cut the pegboard to 12&amp;quot;x12&amp;quot;, and I cut
a scrap of wood to 12&amp;quot;x14&amp;quot; for the base. &amp;nbsp;I made this one larger so I
could clamp it to a desk to keep it stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4kgtwJwBiYg/UL-_XJfMW6I/AAAAAAAACC8/dCMFqoPAklE/s1600/IMG_1965.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4kgtwJwBiYg/UL-_XJfMW6I/AAAAAAAACC8/dCMFqoPAklE/s400/IMG_1965.JPG" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the frame of the base, I ripped some 2x4 pieces into 2x2 ish stock.
&amp;nbsp;To make this easier to assemble, I made four of these, cut to 10 1/2&amp;quot;
long, and arranged them so that they butt up against the others, as seen
in the picture above. &amp;nbsp;They went together fairly cleanly, but there were
some air gaps, but this isn't important as the foil tape will seal it up
later. &amp;nbsp;I specifically wasn't concerned about tolerances on this as I
knew the tape would cover it anyway. &amp;nbsp;The stock is held together using
metal brackets, also seen in the above picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8-MM72N65BU/UL-_YL79NUI/AAAAAAAACDE/izu1UOnXXlQ/s1600/IMG_1967.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8-MM72N65BU/UL-_YL79NUI/AAAAAAAACDE/izu1UOnXXlQ/s400/IMG_1967.JPG" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The base plate got a 2 1/2&amp;quot; diameter hole in it to accept the shop vac
hose. &amp;nbsp;I would have used a hole cutter to do this, but I didn't have
one. &amp;nbsp;Instead, I drilled a pilot hole and used a scroll saw to cut out
the hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DtNSJ742Clc/UL-_Y0t_S4I/AAAAAAAACDM/VSP2y4vg6SU/s1600/IMG_1969.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DtNSJ742Clc/UL-_Y0t_S4I/AAAAAAAACDM/VSP2y4vg6SU/s400/IMG_1969.JPG" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frame is then screwed to the base plate (pre-drilling all holes, of
course) and to the pegboard using drywall screws, AKA the &amp;quot;duct tape of
screws&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UnLOF4acukc/UL-_ZdJ_DGI/AAAAAAAACDQ/JAskrC2gAp0/s1600/IMG_1973.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image4" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UnLOF4acukc/UL-_ZdJ_DGI/AAAAAAAACDQ/JAskrC2gAp0/s400/IMG_1973.JPG" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next comes the foil tape to seal it up.&amp;nbsp;Finally some door weather
stripping to act as a good seal with the material frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JeBVTGeTK4A/UL-_Z8kPLOI/AAAAAAAACDc/lR72LIkHEpY/s1600/IMG_1974.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image5" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JeBVTGeTK4A/UL-_Z8kPLOI/AAAAAAAACDc/lR72LIkHEpY/s400/IMG_1974.JPG" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The material frame was made with some 1x2 stock or whatever this was,
from the scrap pile. &amp;nbsp;It was simply drilled and screwed together with
more... drywall screws!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kLZM6qhBDt8/UL-_cCU7tOI/AAAAAAAACDs/Az9mpjdvlvQ/s1600/IMG_1988.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image6" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kLZM6qhBDt8/UL-_cCU7tOI/AAAAAAAACDs/Az9mpjdvlvQ/s400/IMG_1988.JPG" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The material is taped to the frame (for now... in the future, I'll build
a better, less cumbersome way to secure the material.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xS3GfdHJFJU/UL-_cqN6V3I/AAAAAAAACD0/3imKVG31wmA/s1600/IMG_1992.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image7" class="aligncenter" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xS3GfdHJFJU/UL-_cqN6V3I/AAAAAAAACD0/3imKVG31wmA/s400/IMG_1992.JPG" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I heated it with a heat gun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UHG5XenE6tA/UL-_dINg1HI/AAAAAAAACD8/eCvcQ7u4i-I/s1600/IMG_1995.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image8" class="aligncenter" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UHG5XenE6tA/UL-_dINg1HI/AAAAAAAACD8/eCvcQ7u4i-I/s400/IMG_1995.JPG" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was time, the&amp;nbsp;shop vac&amp;nbsp;went on, and I lowered the framed
material down onto the plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... How did it work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not great. &amp;nbsp;It was&amp;nbsp;ridiculously&amp;nbsp;difficult to get the material heated
consistently and hot enough. &amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;heat gun&amp;nbsp;would burn a hole through the
material if left in one place, but the material cooled off too quickly
if you moved away from it for too long. &amp;nbsp;I need to build a heater rig to
prepare the material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eJFRXNSEJKI/UL-_ekV3DJI/AAAAAAAACEM/O1sO0CMSA-g/s1600/IMG_1998.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image9" class="aligncenter" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eJFRXNSEJKI/UL-_ekV3DJI/AAAAAAAACEM/O1sO0CMSA-g/s400/IMG_1998.JPG" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attempted to re-heat the material with hopes of getting it hot enough
to pull in, while the vacuum was on. &amp;nbsp;It helped a little, but was quite
tricky to work with. &amp;nbsp;I then removed the foamcore miniature arcade
machine, and continued, thinking its height might be an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5EipH73NrAk/UL-_fb7GZaI/AAAAAAAACEU/7P3lAK65QK8/s1600/IMG_2003.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image10" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5EipH73NrAk/UL-_fb7GZaI/AAAAAAAACEU/7P3lAK65QK8/s400/IMG_2003.JPG" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I overheated some of it, melting through the plastic sheet. &amp;nbsp;Oops. &amp;nbsp;But
you can clearly see the Duplo blocks, and the stupid Jar-Jar in the
plastic. &amp;nbsp;Unfortunately, Jar-Jar made it unscathed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I wasn't expecting was the odor of the plastic, especially
this green plastic seen above. MAN, does it smell horrible. &amp;nbsp;When you
see people mentioning &amp;quot;work in a well&amp;nbsp;ventilated&amp;nbsp;area&amp;quot; they aren't
kidding. The plastic continued to have a foul odor for a few hours after
it cooled down. I had to drive home
from&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/"&gt;Interlock&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;with my windows down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It shows promise, but it's not quite there yet. &amp;nbsp;I wouldn't call it a
success, but I wouldn't call it a failure either.&lt;/p&gt;

quickly approaching, I needed to do something about it. &amp;nbsp;The push button
for the start/stop function has been getting harder and harder to use.
&amp;nbsp;In the past, I've cracked it open and cleaned out the pad underneath
the rubberized button membrane, but this time, doing this didn't work. I
also &amp;nbsp;wanted a more permanent fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-W2RX7bp_FDQ/ULTZfXs02OI/AAAAAAAAB-k/J9ZA4wveUHw/s1600/l_6x6x9mm-tactile-push-button-switch-momentary-x200-a97d.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-W2RX7bp_FDQ/ULTZfXs02OI/AAAAAAAAB-k/J9ZA4wveUHw/s320/l_6x6x9mm-tactile-push-button-switch-momentary-x200-a97d.JPG" style="width: 320px; height: 320px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to replace the membrane switch for that function with one of
these tactile buttons. &amp;nbsp;I just had to make sure that the solder pads
would line up. &amp;nbsp;I worked out an orientation in which the solder pads
would match the pushbutton pads, as you can see in the next image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5CeberbMixw/ULTZM7UihAI/AAAAAAAAB-I/wLUai6clHPo/s1600/2012-11-20+22.05.48.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5CeberbMixw/ULTZM7UihAI/AAAAAAAAB-I/wLUai6clHPo/s400/2012-11-20+22.05.48.jpg" style="width: 298px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only issue is that rather than the rubber membrane sitting flush
with the board, it now had to&amp;nbsp;accommodate&amp;nbsp;the shape and size of the
switch along with the button which extended out quite far. &amp;nbsp;I used a
pair of diagonal cutters to nip away at the rubber from behind to recess
the switch into the button itself, Ben Heck style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EEh7ZDp8H7o/ULTZNu0snjI/AAAAAAAAB-Q/1oGXGXTRpho/s1600/2012-11-20+22.08.16.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EEh7ZDp8H7o/ULTZNu0snjI/AAAAAAAAB-Q/1oGXGXTRpho/s400/2012-11-20+22.08.16.jpg" style="width: 298px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see this in the top right of the gray membrane. &amp;nbsp;The two contact
pads have been removed, and instead there is the hole, into which the
switch recesses. &amp;nbsp;The hole was made fairly crudely, but it works!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hS3feisTxMk/ULTZOc3WfZI/AAAAAAAAB-Y/-IID8imYNqI/s1600/2012-11-20+22.17.39.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hS3feisTxMk/ULTZOc3WfZI/AAAAAAAAB-Y/-IID8imYNqI/s320/2012-11-20+22.17.39.jpg" style="width: 239px; height: 320px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been accidentally abused over the years, and as a result, the
screws on the bottom no longer hold it together as the plastic has
broken enough. &amp;nbsp;The strip of electrical tape around the base does well
to hold it together while still looking super stylish! NOTE: It's not
actually very stylish, but rather, functional and should last for many
years more to come. &amp;nbsp;No reason to throw it out, when an hour or so of
work will get it fully functional again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize the overall project; &amp;nbsp;I want to build a device that will
illuminate an UV light-erasable ROM (EPROM) device, and also dump out
its contents. I will then take the contents, display them as a graphic,
and animate them over time as the bits fade away into an erased
oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ptkXdzVAcIg/UJqOvYeUR5I/AAAAAAAAB6k/R7b3MIyQJVA/s1600/2012-11-07+11.35.20.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ptkXdzVAcIg/UJqOvYeUR5I/AAAAAAAAB6k/R7b3MIyQJVA/s400/2012-11-07+11.35.20.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 387px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we last left this, the above circuit was what I was going
to work with. &amp;nbsp;The Arduino would shift out a 16 bit address, which will
be stored in the 74HC595 serial-in, parallel-out shift registers. &amp;nbsp;Those
would out&amp;nbsp;I was all set to place the order, but then I started thinking
about other ways to sample the data, and then it hit me...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late 1980s, I had an Amiga 1000 computer (see previous post about
restoring it). &amp;nbsp;We used Macintosh SE computers in High School, and as a
result, we bought the&amp;nbsp; &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://crossconnect.tripod.com/AMAXHIST.HTML"&gt;&amp;quot;AMAX&amp;quot; Macintosh emulation system for the Amiga&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;It was a lot
easier to carry a floppy or two, rather than a SE or SE/30 in a plastic
milk crate, not to mention that MacWrite was a substantially better word
processor than TextCraft. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMAX consisted of software you run that emulated the Mac's hardware, as
well as a &amp;quot;cartridge&amp;quot; that plugged into the floppy drive port of the
Amiga. &amp;nbsp;I remember hearing that they went with the floppy drive port
because it was the only appropriate port identical on all Amigas that
were available at the time. (Amiga 1000, 500, 2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cartridge served two functions. First, it let you plug in a Mac
floppy drive right into the Amiga so that you could read and write 800k
Mac floppies directly. &amp;nbsp;There was something about Amiga drives and Mac
drives supporting a different number of drive speeds, so full
Mac&amp;nbsp;compatibility&amp;nbsp;on the Amiga's drives was directly impossible. &amp;nbsp;Future
versions of AMAX that used an internal card on the Amiga 2000 worked
around this issue. &amp;nbsp;It was possible to make a floppy that supported just
the sectors/speeds that were the same on both, but they only stored 272k
of content. &amp;nbsp;But I digress...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other function of the cartridge was that you needed to plug in Mac
roms into it, which the software would read in as it starts. &amp;nbsp;Rather
than storing the ROM on the Amiga, this protected the copyrights or
whatever. &amp;nbsp;But the important thing here is the function. &amp;nbsp;I had picked
up a few AMAX cartridges for $2 apiece at the awesome&amp;nbsp; &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.activesurplus.ca/en/"&gt;Active Surplus on Queen Street in Toronto&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;a bunch
of years back, so I dug one out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7Q7anY45dnM/UJyUgpiEVAI/AAAAAAAAB7M/U3p_sw6izzM/s1600/2012-11-08+22.59.34.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7Q7anY45dnM/UJyUgpiEVAI/AAAAAAAAB7M/U3p_sw6izzM/s640/2012-11-08+22.59.34.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 401px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Left-to-Right, you see: Amiga D23 floppy connector, for connecting it to
your Amiga, two 28 pin rom sockets, two 74LS393s, one 74LS165, a
resistor, some diodes, a 74LS139, the Mac D19 floppy connector on the
bottom, then the Amiga D23 floppy connector for adding additional Amiga
floppy drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-18w4vJIID1g/UJyU1jLxhdI/AAAAAAAAB7c/kg4tRl3TVUk/s1600/2012-11-08+23.53.05.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-18w4vJIID1g/UJyU1jLxhdI/AAAAAAAAB7c/kg4tRl3TVUk/s640/2012-11-08+23.53.05.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 476px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've started to trace out the circuit, but it became obvious quickly
that it was optimized for board layout rather than what I would consider
to be a sane arrangements of data lines. &amp;nbsp;For example the 8 data output
lines of the ROMs go into the 74LS165 PISO shift register out of order,
so they need to be reshuffled once captured in the host computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead I decided to desolder the chips! &amp;nbsp;My guess at the original
function is something like: the Amiga issues a clear to the 74LS393
binary counter chips, ganged together to yeield a 16 bit output, rather
than two dual-4 bit outputs. &amp;nbsp;This will reset their 16 bit output value
to 0. &amp;nbsp;The 74LS165 parallel-in, serial-out register then latches the 8
bit output from the ROM, and provides it through shifting to the Amiga
via the floppy port. &amp;nbsp;From there, you need to simply pulse the clock on
the '393, and it will&amp;nbsp;increment&amp;nbsp;through every address. Then you just
latch and shift in the data. There's also a 74LS139 demultiplexer, which
might be responsible for sequencing through those events, or perhaps
something to do with the Mac floppy drive. I had a slight mishap and
lost the 74LS165, which is okay since I didn't need it for this project
anyway. &amp;nbsp;Regardless, $2 plus some time -- I'm already ahead and I
haven't even removed the D23s yet (which are the same size as Amiga RGB
Video connectors! Perfect for another project...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For fun, here's the board with no components on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yPhGkww2fo0/UJx-TvHFDFI/AAAAAAAAB64/ZW5j5cNhgYY/s1600/2012-11-08+21.56.26.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image5" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yPhGkww2fo0/UJx-TvHFDFI/AAAAAAAAB64/ZW5j5cNhgYY/s320/2012-11-08+21.56.26.jpg" style="width: 320px; height: 210px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a slight change in gears I can adapt my design to use the
parts I now have in my toolbox thanks to my desoldering tools. &amp;nbsp;Instead
of the Arduino shifting out an address, it will instead do the process
described above. &amp;nbsp;It will first clear the 393s, then alternately cycle
between clocking out a pulse to increment their values, and reading in
the value directly. Since I'm accessing the ROM data from start to
finish, sequentially anyway, this solution works out perfectly. &amp;nbsp;I also
show four LEDs in the above diagram. Three for various status, one for
UV illumination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cWIzW2S6maY/UKPpxw8t2JI/AAAAAAAAB9I/0FMuEhfRqEg/s1600/2012-11-13+22.30.40.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image6" class="aligncenter" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cWIzW2S6maY/UKPpxw8t2JI/AAAAAAAAB9I/0FMuEhfRqEg/s640/2012-11-13+22.30.40.png" style="width: 426px; height: 640px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a close up of a 27C128 part. This one has Pac-Man programmed
onto it... of course. &amp;nbsp;You can see through the quartz window, and down
onto the EPROM silicon itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Nkxzmx4wLjA/UKRyi43rfVI/AAAAAAAAB9g/KBX-JvT5krk/s1600/2012-11-14+23.16.29.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image7" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Nkxzmx4wLjA/UKRyi43rfVI/AAAAAAAAB9g/KBX-JvT5krk/s400/2012-11-14+23.16.29.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 268px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we see the pins on the Arduino, and how the connect to the shield's
bus connections, along with the LEDs. &amp;nbsp;I could draw this up in a
computerey drawing program, but sketching it out in Sharpie on graph
paper is just&amp;nbsp;quicker... and more Mimsian. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-A1qXIZxizuU/UKRyoHy1G0I/AAAAAAAAB9o/y9jV7rs69_0/s1600/2012-11-14+23.16.36.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image8" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-A1qXIZxizuU/UKRyoHy1G0I/AAAAAAAAB9o/y9jV7rs69_0/s400/2012-11-14+23.16.36.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 247px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the &amp;nbsp;two 74LS393's. &amp;nbsp; You can see their connection to the
address lines on the ROM, as well as the cascading of the counter, e.g.
from 1QD to 2A, and from 2QD to 1A on the second chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ouX_QPqw_mU/UKRyskKJwEI/AAAAAAAAB9w/LgIR8UIhkcc/s1600/2012-11-14+23.16.44.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image9" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ouX_QPqw_mU/UKRyskKJwEI/AAAAAAAAB9w/LgIR8UIhkcc/s400/2012-11-14+23.16.44.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 250px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the wiring for the 28 pin socket, including the 3 pin (two-way)
jumper so that i can use smaller 24 pin parts as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the UV illumination... &amp;nbsp;The data sheets for the EPROMs show that
they should be erased with 253.7 nanometer light, at 15-20 minutes,
2.5cm distance at 15 Watt/seconds per cm^2. &amp;nbsp;I dont know how to measure
this with respect to LEDs, but I'm going to just wing it and see what
happens. &amp;nbsp;The sheet also says that 253.7nm is the optimal wavelength for
erasing them, but anything below 400nm should work. &amp;nbsp;I believe the UV
LEDs I have are somewhere between 350nm and 400nm, so it should work.
&amp;nbsp;The other issue is that the LEDs are substantially less powerful,
probably a tenth to a hundredth the power. We'll see once we get this
going, but I expect it will take on the order of weeks to erase a rom,
rather than minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good thing about this project, in comparison to using EPROMs
functionally, is that you want speed of erasure for functional use. &amp;nbsp;I
personally found that my eraser worked on most of the devices I own in
about 10 minutes. &amp;nbsp;I would often have a chip or two in the eraser, while
programming and debugging others. &amp;nbsp;It worked out fairly well. &amp;nbsp;For this
project, it's&amp;nbsp;completely&amp;nbsp;okay if it takes on the order of hours to erase
a device. &amp;nbsp;I'll find out how well it works once I get it going. &amp;nbsp;I may
use more than one LED just to speed it up a little, in case it takes on
the order of days instead of minutes or hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7pdS0XmtszQ/UKPeqW1OBtI/AAAAAAAAB8Q/s9vl4QBZE_U/s1600/2012-11-10+00.56.30.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image10" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7pdS0XmtszQ/UKPeqW1OBtI/AAAAAAAAB8Q/s9vl4QBZE_U/s400/2012-11-10+00.56.30.jpg" style="width: 298px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started laying out the board at home, wiring in just the LEDs, and
figuring out the best layout for the chips. &amp;nbsp;I used the `&amp;nbsp;DIY shield for Arduino from AdaFruit.com &amp;lt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/187"&gt;https://www.adafruit.com/products/187&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;`__&amp;nbsp;as the
foundation to build this upon. &amp;nbsp;I wanted to leave space for possibly
using larger chips in the future, so what is the bottom of the board
here has space for a few extra data lines if i re-route that red power
line. &amp;nbsp;The '393's are layed out so that the one on the right, which
addresses bits A0-A7 has four of its lines directly lined up. &amp;nbsp;This was
to try to make it a little easier to wire up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6xhutFXwlfI/UKPfE_04XSI/AAAAAAAAB8g/h03Dg45PIk0/s1600/2012-11-14+02.07.22.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image11" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6xhutFXwlfI/UKPfE_04XSI/AAAAAAAAB8g/h03Dg45PIk0/s320/2012-11-14+02.07.22.jpg" style="width: 239px; height: 320px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3Ob_H7OLtbM/UKPfD_4KspI/AAAAAAAAB8Y/IVNUHdtJAkk/s1600/2012-11-14+00.00.38.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image12" class="aligncenter" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3Ob_H7OLtbM/UKPfD_4KspI/AAAAAAAAB8Y/IVNUHdtJAkk/s320/2012-11-14+00.00.38.jpg" style="width: 320px; height: 239px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought some wire wrap wire for address, data, and
control lines, and did most of the work of wiring those up&amp;nbsp; &lt;a class="reference external" href="/"&gt;one evening at Interlock&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I used red for
control (counter clear, clock data cascade lines) as well as eprom
address lines. &amp;nbsp;I used blue for data lines. &amp;nbsp;In the above pictures you
can see how the wires were routed around (there was some more writing on
the bottom, obviously.) You can also see how the UV LEDs are mounted
with some stiff solid core wire. &amp;nbsp;I reduced the number of LEDs to two
plus the UV LEDs for no real reason at all. &amp;nbsp;(There is an Arduino
underneath there somewhere...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the two images above, you can see a jumper on the left of the first
image, bottom of the second image... this changes what one pin is used
for. &amp;nbsp;For smaller EPROMs, pin 26 of the 28 pin footprint is used for
VCC, powering the chip. &amp;nbsp;In the larger packages, VCC is moved to pin 28,
and pin 26 is used for Address line 13. &amp;nbsp;It's confusing. &amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ah_ZDi13ZcngdFlfcDJHWERpNUVGMlBYR0dvdE1kdnc"&gt;A table that shows all of the pinouts&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;doesn't
really help too much, but it was necessary so that I could figure things
out for wiring it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YTbYoRlJDnQ/UKPfF034T1I/AAAAAAAAB8s/NsEVhDXgH9M/s1600/2012-11-14+02.17.32.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image13" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YTbYoRlJDnQ/UKPfF034T1I/AAAAAAAAB8s/NsEVhDXgH9M/s400/2012-11-14+02.17.32.png" style="width: 400px; height: 340px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next is firmware. I wrote a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.umlautllama.com/rand/ROM-Project-Arduino.txt"&gt;pretty simple program for the Arduino&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that
simply enables the EPROM, resets the counters, then clocks through the
addresses, reads them in and sends that data down through the serial
link. &amp;nbsp;After getting the enable lines wrong (active low, rather than
active high), I managed to get it spitting out actual accurate ROM
contents. &amp;nbsp;As you can see in the above, it read out of the ROM (right
half) 0xf3, 0x3e, 0x00, and so on. &amp;nbsp;In a disassembly of Ms PacMan on the
left, you can see these bytes in cyan, just to the right of the red
numbers 0000, 0001, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other half is a simple program that runs on a host computer that
simply reads in serial data and logs it out to a file. &amp;nbsp;That content
looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've now had this running for 12 hours with no change in the bits at
all. &amp;nbsp;I'm thinking that it will require running for upwards of a week or
two to have any affect on bits. &amp;nbsp;I may need to just drop the Arduino and
ROM shield into my eraser to get the results I'm looking for... or at
least a &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; to prove that the idea has a chance of working from
here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If nothing else, I now have a way to read EPROMS from an Arduino.
&amp;nbsp;Awesome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize the overall project; &amp;nbsp;I want to build a device that will
illuminate an UV light-erasable ROM (EPROM) device, and also dump out
its contents. I will then take the contents, display them as a graphic,
and animate them over time as the bits fade away into an erased
oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ptkXdzVAcIg/UJqOvYeUR5I/AAAAAAAAB6k/R7b3MIyQJVA/s1600/2012-11-07+11.35.20.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ptkXdzVAcIg/UJqOvYeUR5I/AAAAAAAAB6k/R7b3MIyQJVA/s400/2012-11-07+11.35.20.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 387px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we last left this, the above circuit was what I was going
to work with. &amp;nbsp;The Arduino would shift out a 16 bit address, which will
be stored in the 74HC595 serial-in, parallel-out shift registers. &amp;nbsp;Those
would out&amp;nbsp;I was all set to place the order, but then I started thinking
about other ways to sample the data, and then it hit me...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late 1980s, I had an Amiga 1000 computer (see previous post about
restoring it). &amp;nbsp;We used Macintosh SE computers in High School, and as a
result, we bought the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://crossconnect.tripod.com/AMAXHIST.HTML"&gt;&amp;quot;AMAX&amp;quot; Macintosh emulation system for the
Amiga&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;It was a lot
easier to carry a floppy or two, rather than a SE or SE/30 in a plastic
milk crate, not to mention that MacWrite was a substantially better word
processor than TextCraft. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMAX consisted of software you run that emulated the Mac's hardware, as
well as a &amp;quot;cartridge&amp;quot; that plugged into the floppy drive port of the
Amiga. &amp;nbsp;I remember hearing that they went with the floppy drive port
because it was the only appropriate port identical on all Amigas that
were available at the time. (Amiga 1000, 500, 2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cartridge served two functions. First, it let you plug in a Mac
floppy drive right into the Amiga so that you could read and write 800k
Mac floppies directly. &amp;nbsp;There was something about Amiga drives and Mac
drives supporting a different number of drive speeds, so full
Mac&amp;nbsp;compatibility&amp;nbsp;on the Amiga's drives was directly impossible. &amp;nbsp;Future
versions of AMAX that used an internal card on the Amiga 2000 worked
around this issue. &amp;nbsp;It was possible to make a floppy that supported just
the sectors/speeds that were the same on both, but they only stored 272k
of content. &amp;nbsp;But I digress...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other function of the cartridge was that you needed to plug in Mac
roms into it, which the software would read in as it starts. &amp;nbsp;Rather
than storing the ROM on the Amiga, this protected the copyrights or
whatever. &amp;nbsp;But the important thing here is the function. &amp;nbsp;I had picked
up a few AMAX cartridges for $2 apiece at the awesome&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.activesurplus.ca/en/"&gt;Active Surplus
on Queen Street in Toronto&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;a bunch
of years back, so I dug one out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7Q7anY45dnM/UJyUgpiEVAI/AAAAAAAAB7M/U3p_sw6izzM/s1600/2012-11-08+22.59.34.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7Q7anY45dnM/UJyUgpiEVAI/AAAAAAAAB7M/U3p_sw6izzM/s640/2012-11-08+22.59.34.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 401px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Left-to-Right, you see: Amiga D23 floppy connector, for connecting it to
your Amiga, two 28 pin rom sockets, two 74LS393s, one 74LS165, a
resistor, some diodes, a 74LS139, the Mac D19 floppy connector on the
bottom, then the Amiga D23 floppy connector for adding additional Amiga
floppy drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-18w4vJIID1g/UJyU1jLxhdI/AAAAAAAAB7c/kg4tRl3TVUk/s1600/2012-11-08+23.53.05.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-18w4vJIID1g/UJyU1jLxhdI/AAAAAAAAB7c/kg4tRl3TVUk/s640/2012-11-08+23.53.05.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 476px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've started to trace out the circuit, but it became obvious quickly
that it was optimized for board layout rather than what I would consider
to be a sane arrangements of data lines. &amp;nbsp;For example the 8 data output
lines of the ROMs go into the 74LS165 PISO shift register out of order,
so they need to be reshuffled once captured in the host computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead I decided to desolder the chips! &amp;nbsp;My guess at the original
function is something like: the Amiga issues a clear to the 74LS393
binary counter chips, ganged together to yeield a 16 bit output, rather
than two dual-4 bit outputs. &amp;nbsp;This will reset their 16 bit output value
to 0. &amp;nbsp;The 74LS165 parallel-in, serial-out register then latches the 8
bit output from the ROM, and provides it through shifting to the Amiga
via the floppy port. &amp;nbsp;From there, you need to simply pulse the clock on
the '393, and it will&amp;nbsp;increment&amp;nbsp;through every address. Then you just
latch and shift in the data. There's also a 74LS139 demultiplexer, which
might be responsible for sequencing through those events, or perhaps
something to do with the Mac floppy drive. I had a slight mishap and
lost the 74LS165, which is okay since I didn't need it for this project
anyway. &amp;nbsp;Regardless, $2 plus some time -- I'm already ahead and I
haven't even removed the D23s yet (which are the same size as Amiga RGB
Video connectors! Perfect for another project...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a slight change in gears I can adapt my design to use the
parts I now have in my toolbox thanks to my desoldering tools. &amp;nbsp;Instead
of the Arduino shifting out an address, it will instead do the process
described above. &amp;nbsp;It will first clear the 393s, then alternately cycle
between clocking out a pulse to increment their values, and reading in
the value directly. Since I'm accessing the ROM data from start to
finish, sequentially anyway, this solution works out perfectly. &amp;nbsp;I also
show four LEDs in the above diagram. Three for various status, one for
UV illumination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cWIzW2S6maY/UKPpxw8t2JI/AAAAAAAAB9I/0FMuEhfRqEg/s1600/2012-11-13+22.30.40.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image6" class="aligncenter" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cWIzW2S6maY/UKPpxw8t2JI/AAAAAAAAB9I/0FMuEhfRqEg/s640/2012-11-13+22.30.40.png" style="width: 426px; height: 640px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a close up of a 27C128 part. This one has Pac-Man programmed
onto it... of course. &amp;nbsp;You can see through the quartz window, and down
onto the EPROM silicon itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Nkxzmx4wLjA/UKRyi43rfVI/AAAAAAAAB9g/KBX-JvT5krk/s1600/2012-11-14+23.16.29.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image7" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Nkxzmx4wLjA/UKRyi43rfVI/AAAAAAAAB9g/KBX-JvT5krk/s400/2012-11-14+23.16.29.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 268px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we see the pins on the Arduino, and how the connect to the shield's
bus connections, along with the LEDs. &amp;nbsp;I could draw this up in a
computerey drawing program, but sketching it out in Sharpie on graph
paper is just&amp;nbsp;quicker... and more Mimsian. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-A1qXIZxizuU/UKRyoHy1G0I/AAAAAAAAB9o/y9jV7rs69_0/s1600/2012-11-14+23.16.36.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image8" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-A1qXIZxizuU/UKRyoHy1G0I/AAAAAAAAB9o/y9jV7rs69_0/s400/2012-11-14+23.16.36.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 247px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the &amp;nbsp;two 74LS393's. &amp;nbsp; You can see their connection to the
address lines on the ROM, as well as the cascading of the counter, e.g.
from 1QD to 2A, and from 2QD to 1A on the second chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ouX_QPqw_mU/UKRyskKJwEI/AAAAAAAAB9w/LgIR8UIhkcc/s1600/2012-11-14+23.16.44.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image9" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ouX_QPqw_mU/UKRyskKJwEI/AAAAAAAAB9w/LgIR8UIhkcc/s400/2012-11-14+23.16.44.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 250px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the wiring for the 28 pin socket, including the 3 pin (two-way)
jumper so that i can use smaller 24 pin parts as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the UV illumination... &amp;nbsp;The data sheets for the EPROMs show that
they should be erased with 253.7 nanometer light, at 15-20 minutes,
2.5cm distance at 15 Watt/seconds per cm^2. &amp;nbsp;I dont know how to measure
this with respect to LEDs, but I'm going to just wing it and see what
happens. &amp;nbsp;The sheet also says that 253.7nm is the optimal wavelength for
erasing them, but anything below 400nm should work. &amp;nbsp;I believe the UV
LEDs I have are somewhere between 350nm and 400nm, so it should work.
&amp;nbsp;The other issue is that the LEDs are substantially less powerful,
probably a tenth to a hundredth the power. We'll see once we get this
going, but I expect it will take on the order of weeks to erase a rom,
rather than minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good thing about this project, in comparison to using EPROMs
functionally, is that you want speed of erasure for functional use. &amp;nbsp;I
personally found that my eraser worked on most of the devices I own in
about 10 minutes. &amp;nbsp;I would often have a chip or two in the eraser, while
programming and debugging others. &amp;nbsp;It worked out fairly well. &amp;nbsp;For this
project, it's&amp;nbsp;completely&amp;nbsp;okay if it takes on the order of hours to erase
a device. &amp;nbsp;I'll find out how well it works once I get it going. &amp;nbsp;I may
use more than one LED just to speed it up a little, in case it takes on
the order of days instead of minutes or hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7pdS0XmtszQ/UKPeqW1OBtI/AAAAAAAAB8Q/s9vl4QBZE_U/s1600/2012-11-10+00.56.30.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image10" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7pdS0XmtszQ/UKPeqW1OBtI/AAAAAAAAB8Q/s9vl4QBZE_U/s400/2012-11-10+00.56.30.jpg" style="width: 298px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started laying out the board at home, wiring in just the LEDs, and
figuring out the best layout for the chips. &amp;nbsp;I used the`&amp;nbsp;DIY shield
for Arduino from
AdaFruit.com &amp;lt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/187"&gt;https://www.adafruit.com/products/187&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;`__&amp;nbsp;as the
foundation to build this upon. &amp;nbsp;I wanted to leave space for possibly
using larger chips in the future, so what is the bottom of the board
here has space for a few extra data lines if i re-route that red power
line. &amp;nbsp;The '393's are layed out so that the one on the right, which
addresses bits A0-A7 has four of its lines directly lined up. &amp;nbsp;This was
to try to make it a little easier to wire up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6xhutFXwlfI/UKPfE_04XSI/AAAAAAAAB8g/h03Dg45PIk0/s1600/2012-11-14+02.07.22.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image11" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6xhutFXwlfI/UKPfE_04XSI/AAAAAAAAB8g/h03Dg45PIk0/s320/2012-11-14+02.07.22.jpg" style="width: 239px; height: 320px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3Ob_H7OLtbM/UKPfD_4KspI/AAAAAAAAB8Y/IVNUHdtJAkk/s1600/2012-11-14+00.00.38.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image12" class="aligncenter" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3Ob_H7OLtbM/UKPfD_4KspI/AAAAAAAAB8Y/IVNUHdtJAkk/s320/2012-11-14+00.00.38.jpg" style="width: 320px; height: 239px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought some wire wrap wire for address, data, and
control lines, and did most of the work of wiring those up&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/"&gt;one
evening at Interlock&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I used red for
control (counter clear, clock data cascade lines) as well as eprom
address lines. &amp;nbsp;I used blue for data lines. &amp;nbsp;In the above pictures you
can see how the wires were routed around (there was some more writing on
the bottom, obviously.) You can also see how the UV LEDs are mounted
with some stiff solid core wire. &amp;nbsp;I reduced the number of LEDs to two
plus the UV LEDs for no real reason at all. &amp;nbsp;(There is an Arduino
underneath there somewhere...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the two images above, you can see a jumper on the left of the first
image, bottom of the second image... this changes what one pin is used
for. &amp;nbsp;For smaller EPROMs, pin 26 of the 28 pin footprint is used for
VCC, powering the chip. &amp;nbsp;In the larger packages, VCC is moved to pin 28,
and pin 26 is used for Address line 13. &amp;nbsp;It's confusing. &amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ah_ZDi13ZcngdFlfcDJHWERpNUVGMlBYR0dvdE1kdnc"&gt;A table that
shows all of the
pinouts&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;doesn't
really help too much, but it was necessary so that I could figure things
out for wiring it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YTbYoRlJDnQ/UKPfF034T1I/AAAAAAAAB8s/NsEVhDXgH9M/s1600/2012-11-14+02.17.32.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image13" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YTbYoRlJDnQ/UKPfF034T1I/AAAAAAAAB8s/NsEVhDXgH9M/s400/2012-11-14+02.17.32.png" style="width: 400px; height: 340px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next is firmware. I wrote a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.umlautllama.com/rand/ROM-Project-Arduino.txt"&gt;pretty simple program for the
Arduino&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that
simply enables the EPROM, resets the counters, then clocks through the
addresses, reads them in and sends that data down through the serial
link. &amp;nbsp;After getting the enable lines wrong (active low, rather than
active high), I managed to get it spitting out actual accurate ROM
contents. &amp;nbsp;As you can see in the above, it read out of the ROM (right
half) 0xf3, 0x3e, 0x00, and so on. &amp;nbsp;In a disassembly of Ms PacMan on the
left, you can see these bytes in cyan, just to the right of the red
numbers 0000, 0001, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other half is a simple program that runs on a host computer that
simply reads in serial data and logs it out to a file. &amp;nbsp;That content
looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've now had this running for 12 hours with no change in the bits at
all. &amp;nbsp;I'm thinking that it will require running for upwards of a week or
two to have any affect on bits. &amp;nbsp;I may need to just drop the Arduino and
ROM shield into my eraser to get the results I'm looking for... or at
least a &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; to prove that the idea has a chance of working from
here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If nothing else, I now have a way to read EPROMS from an Arduino.
&amp;nbsp;Awesome!&lt;/p&gt;

failure. &amp;nbsp;Not everything works. &amp;nbsp;I've had my share of projects that for

of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XJGRCMuyj2o/UJoNvgJQuRI/AAAAAAAAB5s/NPDbRYe7WqE/s1600/2012-11-07+02.07.52.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XJGRCMuyj2o/UJoNvgJQuRI/AAAAAAAAB5s/NPDbRYe7WqE/s640/2012-11-07+02.07.52.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 475px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time now, I've had some ideas that center around EPROMs.
&amp;nbsp;I've been using EPROMS since I started getting into arcade machine
collecting. &amp;nbsp;EPROMs are programmable devices where you can store bytes
of memory in a fairly stable method. &amp;nbsp;They look like any other
microchip, except that they have a transparent window on the top
(usually quartz, even though it looks like glass). &amp;nbsp;If you look in the
window, you can see the chip die in there, which I usually think looks
like a tiny tennis court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above image shows a few different size. &amp;nbsp;The one on the right is a
2716, 16 kilobit (2 kilobyte) device. &amp;nbsp;The one in the middle is a
27C256, 256 kilobit (32 kilobyte) device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-I98O53ShKxo/UJoNZzepHdI/AAAAAAAAB5c/aEIHuJ1Qt6A/s1600/2012-11-07+02.02.53.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-I98O53ShKxo/UJoNZzepHdI/AAAAAAAAB5c/aEIHuJ1Qt6A/s320/2012-11-07+02.02.53.jpg" style="width: 235px; height: 320px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;To use an EPROM, you place it in an eraser, which is usually a
ultraviolet light (often a fluorescent, non-filtered black light tube)
with a timer, for about 10-12 minutes or so. &amp;nbsp;This sets all of the bits
in the device to 1's. &amp;nbsp;(0xff hex).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1kK5sgB9PnU/UJoNkK2lUHI/AAAAAAAAB5k/5D_oMNYxpl4/s1600/2012-11-07+02.04.28.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1kK5sgB9PnU/UJoNkK2lUHI/AAAAAAAAB5k/5D_oMNYxpl4/s400/2012-11-07+02.04.28.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 296px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you take the chip, and plug it into a programmer. &amp;nbsp;A computer tells
the programmer what zeroes to write and where, and you end up with a
chip that has a program or some data stored in it, so that it can be
read out later. &amp;nbsp;Often, the window is then covered up so that they are
not accidentally erased over time from ambient UV light. One data sheet
I read said that 1 week in direct sunlight, or 3 years in normal office
lighting will erase a device. &amp;nbsp;The programmer above is my Needham's
EMP-10. &amp;nbsp;It has a 30 pin simm-looking slot on the side with 3 snap-in
cards that configure the programmer pins so that it can handle a variety
of different target device EPROMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process has fascinated me since I started burning ROMs for use in
arcade machines. &amp;nbsp;This is where this project comes in.&amp;nbsp;I've had a few
thoughts about things to explore here...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, it should be possible to determine which bytes are in
which physical locations on the device by casting a shadow or projecting
an image onto the die from the eraser. &amp;nbsp;It should be possible to
determine this by projecting different patterns on the die with the UV
erasing light. &amp;nbsp;Obviously, it has to be well focused; this has to be
quite precise. &amp;nbsp;A project for another day...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I thought a fun project might be to read the pattern produced
by erasing the device. &amp;nbsp;I would program all zeroes to the EPROM. &amp;nbsp;The
chip would be plugged into an Arduino, to read the data out of it. &amp;nbsp;The
Arduino would also control a UV LED or two which would illuminate the
window on the EPROM, erasing it. &amp;nbsp;It would then alternate between
illuminating the window and reading the content out of it. &amp;nbsp;The data
pulled out would then be displayed as an image with pixels white if the
content is a '1', and black if it is a '0'. &amp;nbsp;This should show all white
at the start, and all black at the end, with some amount of dithering in
the middle somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bLHjaeRhyTs/UJoNH7rnlMI/AAAAAAAAB5I/UdksQ0NSy0U/s1600/2012-11-07+01.58.52.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bLHjaeRhyTs/UJoNH7rnlMI/AAAAAAAAB5I/UdksQ0NSy0U/s320/2012-11-07+01.58.52.jpg" style="width: 320px; height: 320px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a bunch of chips pulled from various electronic gadgets over the
years, and the most prevalent of them was this 2732. &amp;nbsp;It has a nice
small package, small data size (4 kilobytes), so downloading the content
from it should be fairly quick... and I have a whole lot of them, so if
a few get destroyed in the process, it's no big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EHaidC5ynzI/UJqCpZJViSI/AAAAAAAAB6Q/hsr864Oeovc/s1600/2012-11-07+12.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image4" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EHaidC5ynzI/UJqCpZJViSI/AAAAAAAAB6Q/hsr864Oeovc/s400/2012-11-07+12.JPG" style="width: 400px; height: 338px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I considered hooking this EPROM up directly to the Arduino, but
I need 24 lines to control it. &amp;nbsp;16 for address to the chip, 8 for data
from the chip. &amp;nbsp;Not to mention a line to drive the LED. &amp;nbsp;I could go with
an Arduino Mega, or Due, but I do not own either. &amp;nbsp;I only really needed
12 of those 16 address lines, which would bring it to 20 IO needed,
which is still more than was available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--ywYLtULcPk/UJqCoRfi1xI/AAAAAAAAB6E/PmrjTU_-fxE/s1600/2012-11-07+11.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image5" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--ywYLtULcPk/UJqCoRfi1xI/AAAAAAAAB6E/PmrjTU_-fxE/s400/2012-11-07+11.JPG" style="width: 400px; height: 291px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have a spare&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mayhewlabs.com/products/arduino-mux-shield"&gt;Mayhew Labs Mux
Shield&lt;/a&gt;, (mine is
a previous version) so I decided to just run with that. &amp;nbsp;Unfortunately
this is where the story goes south. &amp;nbsp;I went from idea to making the
board in one day. I really should have spent more time thinking about
it, and less time being impulsive and just creating the thing. &amp;nbsp;I was
too excited, incorrectly thinking that I had what I needed for the
project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should note that I often enjoy when a project fails. &amp;nbsp;It really helps
me learn what I did wrong, why it didn't work, and then it's like a
puzzle to figure out how to make it work. &amp;nbsp;Sometimes, things just get
frustrating and I will shelve a project indefinitely, but often I figure
things out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wired up a socket, cobbled together from smaller DIP sockets, onto a
piece of strip board. &amp;nbsp;I also threw a few indicator LEDs onto the board
for various runtime display. After an evening of work, I came up with
the board as seen here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vcDaSPXWoTg/UJoM13i_plI/AAAAAAAAB44/74-H3Fn2ZvA/s1600/2012-11-06+22.50.45.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image6" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vcDaSPXWoTg/UJoM13i_plI/AAAAAAAAB44/74-H3Fn2ZvA/s400/2012-11-06+22.50.45.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 296px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-loed2kQYnbY/UJoNDHYXfRI/AAAAAAAAB5A/-sgcl3ynaKI/s1600/2012-11-06+22.50.58.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image7" class="aligncenter" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-loed2kQYnbY/UJoNDHYXfRI/AAAAAAAAB5A/-sgcl3ynaKI/s400/2012-11-06+22.50.58.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 296px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was wired on the circuit side of the board (I do not recommend this)
because then I could easily plug it in to the Mux Shield using the pin
connectors I had. &amp;nbsp;The three red LEDs are wired to a few unused port
pins on the mux, and the frosted LED on the right is an amber LED which
I scuffed the top of to make it glow more than illuminate. &amp;nbsp;I have yet
to power this up, because it was at this point, when I was done building
it that I realized the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mux Shield is an excellent device. I use it for my Jasper Box to
read inputs. &amp;nbsp;For inputs, it's awesome. &amp;nbsp;It'll do 48 IO, even analog
input. &amp;nbsp;For output, that's where it gets a bit&amp;nbsp;non-intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chips used on it are unbuffered. &amp;nbsp;That is to say that there's no way
to specifically sample or store data out or in on it. &amp;nbsp;You pick a line,
and then immediately read or write from it. &amp;nbsp;Think of it as a valve, not
a view. &amp;nbsp;This is to say that at any one point in time, you're only
setting or reading one bit. &amp;nbsp;When reading the EPROM, I want to specify a
single address (16 bits of digital output) then read in the data from
the chip (8 bits of digital input). &amp;nbsp;I can only do one bit at a time, so
it is impossible to set the 16 bits simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for this to work, I need to add a latch of some kind to the
circuit to store the 16 bit address, so that I can then read in the 8
bits of data for that address in the EPROM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FDgWE5um2xI/UJqCnxDW4YI/AAAAAAAAB6A/b3ycReA1ZTY/s1600/2012-11-07+10.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image8" class="aligncenter" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FDgWE5um2xI/UJqCnxDW4YI/AAAAAAAAB6A/b3ycReA1ZTY/s400/2012-11-07+10.JPG" style="width: 327px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a sketch for the next version of this project. &amp;nbsp;As you can see,
instead of using the Mux Shield, I'm now using a pair of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/733"&gt;74HC595
serial-in, parallel-out shift
registers&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;chained together.
&amp;nbsp;The idea here is that I would shift in the address I want to read
through both of the '595s, then latch in the data on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9519"&gt;74HC165
parallel-in, serial-out shift
register&lt;/a&gt;. This is actually
taking it one step too far, since the '165 is unnecessary. &amp;nbsp;The thing on
the left is the UV LED and its resistor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ptkXdzVAcIg/UJqOvYeUR5I/AAAAAAAAB6k/R7b3MIyQJVA/s1600/2012-11-07+11.35.20.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image9" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ptkXdzVAcIg/UJqOvYeUR5I/AAAAAAAAB6k/R7b3MIyQJVA/s400/2012-11-07+11.35.20.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 387px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here's a simplifed version where the data lines of the EPROM are
hooked directly into the Arduino. &amp;nbsp;It also shows three indicator LEDs on
the top, which will be used to show the state of the device at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to order some parts to build this, and once I get them, I will be
posting further results on the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 6 years ago, my Amiga 1000 started showing some strange behaviors
but only in the green levels of the video. &amp;nbsp;If you dragged the green
slider, instead of it stepping up gradually from dark to bright, it
would get brighter, darker, brighter, darker, much brighter, a little
darker than that, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 5 years ago, I had opened it up and replaced two '244 latches in
the video output section. &amp;nbsp;I kinda did this blindly by looking at the
schematic...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, a comment on the above video re-sparked interest in this
project and I decided to bring the Amiga over
to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/"&gt;Interlock&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and really get to the
bottom of the problem. I hooked it up to a scope and followed the paths
according to the schematics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col width="100%" /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Amiga 1000 apart, hooked up to a scope and a LCD monitor.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video circuit is on the left edge of the board, just under the power
cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I traced the lines from input on Q2 (where all of the four resistors in
the D-to-A resistor ladder are joined, and back through to the latch,
and then continuing back to the Denise video generation coprocessor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Z9jwp8H9SmI/UH7Dj99trmI/AAAAAAAABss/JmJd8sqc1C0/s1600/IMG_0548.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image4" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Z9jwp8H9SmI/UH7Dj99trmI/AAAAAAAABss/JmJd8sqc1C0/s400/IMG_0548.JPG" style="width: 400px; height: 298px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried jumpering across various portions of the resistor ladder to try
to track down exactly where the issue was. &amp;nbsp;It gave some pretty
interesting results, but really only helped me track down where the
issue is.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I eventually came to the realization that something on the
R55 data path was drawing it down to ground, or at least close to
ground. (Where the left alligator clip is attached in the above
picture.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table border="1" class="docutils"&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;The &amp;quot;Green&amp;quot; section of the video generation circuit in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;the Amiga 1000 with notes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried pulling out the pins on the Denise's G1 output (pin 29) and
soldering it directly to pin 15 of U6A, and it didn't change anything.
&amp;nbsp;I then pretty much realized that the issue was on the other side of U6A
-- the connection between pin 5 of U6A and the left side of R55 (4k
resistor). &amp;nbsp;I decided to leave the above wire &amp;quot;flying&amp;quot; and pulled the
resistor leg, soldering it directly to pin 5 of U6A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-a3ejuzXFvlE/UH7Dm8-OTcI/AAAAAAAABtE/vTafHBGflXY/s1600/IMG_0565.PNG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image6" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-a3ejuzXFvlE/UH7Dm8-OTcI/AAAAAAAABtE/vTafHBGflXY/s640/IMG_0565.PNG" style="width: 640px; height: 426px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This did the trick! &amp;nbsp;It worked. &amp;nbsp;I probably could have restored the
flying wire back to the original traces on the board, desoldering the
wire, re-seating the chips, but I had flexed those pins in and out a
lot, and decided to not stress out the pins anymore, and just leave it.
&amp;nbsp;-- &amp;quot;It works... don't touch it!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 5 years of it sitting on a shelf, my trusty 'ol Amiga, my favorite
computer, is finally is working again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Z9jwp8H9SmI/UH7Dj99trmI/AAAAAAAABss/JmJd8sqc1C0/s1600/IMG_0548.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image4" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Z9jwp8H9SmI/UH7Dj99trmI/AAAAAAAABss/JmJd8sqc1C0/s400/IMG_0548.JPG" style="width: 400px; height: 298px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried jumpering across various portions of the resistor ladder to try
to track down exactly where the issue was. &amp;nbsp;It gave some pretty
interesting results, but really only helped me track down where the
issue is.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I eventually came to the realization that something on the
R55 data path was drawing it down to ground, or at least close to
ground. (Where the left alligator clip is attached in the above
picture.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried pulling out the pins on the Denise's G1 output (pin 29) and
soldering it directly to pin 15 of U6A, and it didn't change anything.
&amp;nbsp;I then pretty much realized that the issue was on the other side of U6A
-- the connection between pin 5 of U6A and the left side of R55 (4k
resistor). &amp;nbsp;I decided to leave the above wire &amp;quot;flying&amp;quot; and pulled the
resistor leg, soldering it directly to pin 5 of U6A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-a3ejuzXFvlE/UH7Dm8-OTcI/AAAAAAAABtE/vTafHBGflXY/s1600/IMG_0565.PNG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image6" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-a3ejuzXFvlE/UH7Dm8-OTcI/AAAAAAAABtE/vTafHBGflXY/s640/IMG_0565.PNG" style="width: 640px; height: 426px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This did the trick! &amp;nbsp;It worked. &amp;nbsp;I probably could have restored the
flying wire back to the original traces on the board, desoldering the
wire, re-seating the chips, but I had flexed those pins in and out a
lot, and decided to not stress out the pins anymore, and just leave it.
&amp;nbsp;-- &amp;quot;It works... don't touch it!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 5 years of it sitting on a shelf, my trusty 'ol Amiga, my favorite
computer, is finally is working again!&lt;/p&gt;

take the sort of ethics of the classic computer systems from the 1970s,
which by design were considered what we now woud call &amp;quot;homebrew&amp;quot; and
apply them to modern computing. I tried to keep things as stock and
off-the-shelf as possible, so that this was easily reproducible by
others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, building a standard x86 PC from boards is not really in the same
neighborhood of what I wanted to do here. &amp;nbsp;I want to do something with
the feel of the Apple I for example. &amp;nbsp;Buying components, making wiring
harnesses, writing firmware to control it, and having the primary user
interface for it be a BASIC environment, much like the home computers of
the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name &amp;quot;BL-328&amp;quot; is taken in the same way that the TRS-80 got its name
(&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;andy/&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;adio &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;hack Z&lt;strong&gt;80&lt;/strong&gt; based computer.) For
this, I went with &amp;quot;BL&amp;quot; signifying &amp;quot;BleuLlama&amp;quot;, the nickname I use for
IRC, and &amp;quot;328&amp;quot; signifying the ATMega 328 AVR microcontroller in the form
of an &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://arduino.cc"&gt;Arduino&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should note that&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://benheck.com/"&gt;Ben Heckendorn&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;recently
did a similar project, which you can &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.element14.com/community/docs/DOC-49215/l/episode-49-see-ben-hecks-pocket-computer-episode"&gt;watch his project on The Ben Heck
Show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To follow along with this first step, all you will need for the first
step is an Arduino board, available from
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://adafruit.com/category/17"&gt;Adafruit&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/103"&gt;Sparkfun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.radioshack.com/search/index.jsp?kwCatId=&amp;amp;kw=arduino&amp;amp;origkw=arduino&amp;amp;sr=1"&gt;Radio
Shack&lt;/a&gt;,
homemade, etc. &amp;nbsp; The one I'm using is one I bought a few years ago from
Sparkfun, the Arduino Pro.&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/10/2012-09-30-14.38.02.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1009" src="/wp-uploads/2012/10/2012-09-30-14.38.02-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one has the pin header on the right side there which connects to an
FTDI cable to a host computer. &amp;nbsp;I will also be using this connector to
power the entire system through the use of the FTDI-USB cable, AA
Battery holder, or rechargable battery pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start off, I took &amp;quot;TinyBasic&amp;quot; which had been ported for use on the
Arduino by Michael Field, and I have&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/BleuLlama/TinyBasicPlus"&gt;since expanded
upon&lt;/a&gt;(github project
link). &amp;nbsp;I have added SD card support with loading and saving, data pin
IO, as well as graphic functions specific to this project, but I'm
getting ahead of myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downloading that project's TinyBasicPlus.ino to the Arduino will give
you a Basic interface with few hundred bytes of program space free. &amp;nbsp;You
can use the &amp;quot;Serial Monitor&amp;quot; which is bundled with the Arduino IDE to
interact with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arduino has 13 digital IO pins, some of which can be used for
pseudo-analog output through the use of
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation"&gt;PWM&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;nbsp;as well
as 6 analog Input pins,&amp;nbsp;which&amp;nbsp;can also be used for Digital IO. &amp;nbsp;A simple
program to print out 10 results from Analog input 3, and turn on digital
output 5 is as follows: (Note, that this assumes a new feature of
TinyBasicPlus, &amp;quot;autoconfigure&amp;quot; is enabled)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
10 REM example program
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
20 DWRITE 5, HIGH
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
30 FOR A = 0 TO 10
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
40 b = AREAD 3
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
50 PRINT B
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
60 NEXT A
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can write programs that will read port pins, write to port pins, and
then load and save to an SD card, if you have FileIO enabled. &amp;nbsp;The SD
interface I went with from this was the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/sd-card-shield-p-492.html?cPath=109"&gt;SeeedStudio SD Card
Shield&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;which
was&amp;nbsp;reasonably&amp;nbsp;priced at Radio Shack. &amp;nbsp;It is hard-configured for its
&amp;quot;select&amp;quot; to be on pin 10, which is shown in the TinyBasicPlus.ino file.
&amp;nbsp;You will need to comment out the #undef for fileio and SD card support,
and remove the comment for the related #define. &amp;nbsp;In its current state,
it uses the SD library included with the Arduino package, this uses 9k
bytes of program space, which is a lot. &amp;nbsp;I need to find a smaller SD
library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/10/2012-09-30-14.38.15.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1010" src="/wp-uploads/2012/10/2012-09-30-14.38.15-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that this is enabled, the above program could be saved out to the SD
card like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
SAVE example1.bas
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then re-loaded later like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
LOAD example1.bas
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, a feature was added to TinyBasicPlus that lets programs be
autoloaded when you power on. &amp;nbsp;This is especially useful if you want to
write your program (or programs) in BASIC on the device itself, rather
than through the Arduino IDE in C. &amp;nbsp;This is accomplished by enabling the
AUTORUN feature in TinyBasicPlus.ino, and by saving your startup program
as &amp;quot;autorun.bas&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can go a step further and have the end of your program &amp;quot;CHAIN&amp;quot; to
another program. &amp;nbsp;That is to say, you could have it load and run another
program. eg:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the file &amp;quot;autorun.bas&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
10 PRINT &amp;quot;Hello&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
20 CHAIN &amp;quot;two.bas&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the file &amp;quot;two.bas&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
10 PRINT &amp;quot;World!&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
20 CHAIN &amp;quot;autorun.bas&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will start up, run the &amp;quot;autorun.bas&amp;quot;, which will then load the
&amp;quot;two.bas&amp;quot; program, which will chain to the &amp;quot;autorun.bas&amp;quot; program,
forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough with the software though. &amp;nbsp;I'll now get into a bit of the
hardware, namely the power system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, there are a few ways we can power the system.
&amp;nbsp;Currently, since the only interaction you have with it is through the
serial port/FTDI interface, you'll have it powered through that, but
once we bring this thing into a standalone configuration, we'll want
battery power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first power pack is a 4AA battery pack with a switch that I picked
up from Adafruit. This has the power lines wired to a 6-pin interface
like the FTDI interface has. &amp;nbsp;This lets me use standard AA batteries
(rechargable or not) to power the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/10/2012-09-30-14.39.24.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1013" src="/wp-uploads/2012/10/2012-09-30-14.39.24-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up is a USB-based rechargable battery I picked up at the local
supermarket for $20. &amp;nbsp;It's a rechargable (Lithium Ion, perhaps?) battery
with Mini USB input for charging, then standard USB for output. &amp;nbsp;I could
use the FTDI cable off of this, but instead, I decided to make a tiny
adapter so that I can plug it directly in through the same 6 pin
interface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/10/2012-09-30-14.38.45.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1011" src="/wp-uploads/2012/10/2012-09-30-14.38.45-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea how long either of these will power the system for. &amp;nbsp;I'm
guessing a substantial number of hours. &amp;nbsp;I've also since made a cable
that connects between the battery pack and that header, rather than that
little widget pictured above, which is essentially a USB cord whose
power lines are wired directly to the FTDI connector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the above, you can &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ladyada.net/learn/arduino/lesson3.html"&gt;hook up an LED to digital pin
5&lt;/a&gt;, and do a
version of the &amp;quot;Blink&amp;quot; program included with Arduino:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the file &amp;quot;autorun.bas&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
10 REM Basic Blinker
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
20 DWRITE 5, HIGH
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
30 DELAY 500
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
40 DWRITE 5, LOW
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
50 DELAY 500
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
60 GOTO 30
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, disconnect the FTDI cable, hook up the battery, and it should
blink the LED forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it for this time. &amp;nbsp;Soon, we'll convert an old Commodore 64
keyboard into an input device for the computer, add LCD modules for
output, and other goodies so that we'll be able to go standalone and not
need a host computer at all!&lt;/p&gt;

Luxeon LEDs. &amp;nbsp;My original thought was that I would rebuild an lightshow
device that I had built many years ago, but instead of it driving 110V
spot lights through solid state relays, it would instead be more
self-contained, and use high power LEDs instead. &amp;nbsp;This project never
happened, since I never figured out how to power the LEDs properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've recently been getting into doing more little projects, especially
since I want to have &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; to do on Tuesday nights at Interlock.
&amp;nbsp;I saw the box of these things on the shelf, and decided to try driving
them directly from an Arduino. &amp;nbsp; I know that I could have used one of
the BlinkM modules, or the strand of RGB Pixels or whatever for this,
but I had these, and I wanted to see what I could do / how bright I
could make them without frying the Arduino.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/09/2012-09-26-09.10.10-e1348677126508.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-994" src="/wp-uploads/2012/09/2012-09-26-09.10.10-e1348677126508-300x271.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 271px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project I decided to work on with them is to make a single
high-brightness RGB pixel, and drive it from a Processing sketch on my
computer. &amp;nbsp;Eventually, the thought might be to sample a TV's color,
30fps for a few hours, then just store those brightness/color levels.
&amp;nbsp;Then, play them back on the pixel to light a room. &amp;nbsp;From outside of the
room, it &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; look like a television is on, showing some kind of TV
show. &amp;nbsp;The way I went with testing this was to take a movie trailer, and
crunch it down to a few pixels, and then average the colors in it while
it plays back, live via Processing, then send the RGB values over
USB-Serial to be displayed on the pixel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/09/2012-09-26-09.13.51.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-997" src="/wp-uploads/2012/09/2012-09-26-09.13.51-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started out by soldering up a Red, Green, and Blue LED to a small
piece of perf board. &amp;nbsp;I tied them together for a common ground on one
side, and through a 220 ohm resistor on the other side, and all of this
out to the Arduino. &amp;nbsp;I use PWM pins on the Arduino to adjust their
brightness, since that's simple to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/09/2012-09-26-09.11.51.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-995" src="/wp-uploads/2012/09/2012-09-26-09.11.51-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Processing sketch sends down 0..255 for red, green, and blue
intensities, then those values are plugged directly into the PWM pins
via AnalogWrite() calls, which displays a reasonable facsimile of the
color requested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/09/2012-09-26-09.12.31.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-996" src="/wp-uploads/2012/09/2012-09-26-09.12.31-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project worked out pretty darn well. &amp;nbsp;Without current drivers for
the LEDs, I can't make them too bright, but in an hour of sitting down
at Interlock, I had this working. &amp;nbsp;I wrote up two processing sketches.
&amp;nbsp;One with a RGB color wheel - click to send that color to the LEDs, and
another playing the video as described above. &amp;nbsp;(Arduino and Processing
sketches available upon request. :D )&lt;/p&gt;

but I happened to see a couple of 1x2x3 designs available on
Thingiverse...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very shortly after Brian, Alex, and Bill got Interlock's 3D printer
going, I nudged my way in, and got them to print out a twisty puzzle for
me. The puzzle I had printed was &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3737"&gt;this screwless 1x2x3

&lt;p&gt;I decided to go for this one becuase I wanted to have it printed out and

reasons I'll get to later. &amp;nbsp;Anyway... on to the printing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/05/15.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-908" src="/wp-uploads/2012/05/15-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The printer did a great job of producing the pieces, although it would
seem that perhaps the filament was being fed into the printer too
quickly, as tolerances were overshot, and much sanding needed to be
performed just to get it to fit together...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/05/21.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-909" src="/wp-uploads/2012/05/21-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This design included a &amp;quot;barbell&amp;quot; shaped piece that snapped between the
two halves of the core, eliminating the need for screws and springs to
hold it together and give it tension. Because of the lack of support
material, the printer had a difficult time properly printing out this
barbell, as you can see in the following picture. &amp;nbsp;There was nothing to
hold it in place, so it got dragged around a bit as the print head moved
around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/05/40.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-910" src="/wp-uploads/2012/05/40-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step I took was to sand down the parts to get them to fit. The
first thing I tried was sanding the 'feet' that protrude from the wing
pieces. I was getting decent results, but then realized that a better
solution was to sand the semicircular holes in the cores a bit more,
opening them up, making the feet spin in the core more easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/05/41.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image4" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-911" src="/wp-uploads/2012/05/41-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between various nights of heading to Interlock to work on this, and
without the needed barbell piece, I held it together with a rubber band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/05/44.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image5" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-912" src="/wp-uploads/2012/05/44-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, Joe came to my rescue. &amp;nbsp;He extracted the barbell piece out of the
STL file, sliced it in half, then printed those two halves for me. &amp;nbsp;This
time using the stylish metallic gray filament, rather than the stylish
orange filament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/05/50.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image6" class="size-medium wp-image-913 aligncenter" src="/wp-uploads/2012/05/50-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/05/53.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image7" class="size-medium wp-image-915" src="/wp-uploads/2012/05/53-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little bit of super glue, and a little bit of sanding, and they were
ready to install inside of the twisty puzzle's core. &amp;nbsp;Within minutes,&amp;nbsp;it
was assembled properly for the first time! The barbell/snap assembly is
a bit loose, and I think that some of the feet were sanded down a little
too much, as there is a lot of play in the fit of the parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/05/55.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image8" class="size-medium wp-image-914 aligncenter" src="/wp-uploads/2012/05/55-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/05/57.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image9" class="size-medium wp-image-917" src="/wp-uploads/2012/05/57-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was planning on perhaps dyeing it, or just sanding more and stickering
it with the expected color scheme (red, orange, green, blue, white,
yellow) but Nick had asked me a little about rotational symmetry of the
puzzle, and a few minutes later, he had stickered it with blue painter's
tape. It was an ingenious solution, as no two pieces are stickered with
the same pattern. (Note that you can also see the floppy tolerances on
the top left piece of the next photo.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/05/60.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image10" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-916" src="/wp-uploads/2012/05/60-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After playing with it for a while, the barbell is definitely the weak
point of the whole thing. &amp;nbsp;I had sanded it a little to get it to turn
more smoothly, but now it's way too loose. &amp;nbsp;The wing pieces are a bit
floppy due to sanding. &amp;nbsp; I think that these two things can easily be
changed for the next print, by first using TomZ's design which can use a
screw to hold it together, and also being more cautious while sanding to
keep everything within decent tolerances.&lt;/p&gt;

been wanting to make a 1x2x3 puzzle for a while, probably &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPeiQKmoaUc"&gt;making one my
own from spare parts&lt;/a&gt;,
but I happened to see a couple of 1x2x3 designs available on
Thingiverse...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very shortly after Brian, Alex, and Bill got Interlock's 3D printer
going, I nudged my way in, and got them to print out a twisty puzzle for
me. The puzzle I had printed was &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3737"&gt;this screwless 1x2x3
model&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/05/11.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-907" src="/wp-uploads/2012/05/11-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to go for this one becuase I wanted to have it printed out and
ready to go as qucickly as possible. &amp;nbsp;In retrospect, I should have gone
