been going through some changes but it still doesn't reflect what's
been happening in the space. We're going to change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This coming Tuesday, we'll be holding a website hackathon to get
people into web technologies and discuss various different architectures.
The idea will be that we'll discuss different types of technologies
and ways of hosting the website so that no only do we up-date our
own page, but we'll show you how to update yours as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our design goals are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FOSS Friendly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distributed responsibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe not in that order.&lt;/p&gt;

Interlock HAM radio station K2HAX will be participating in the &lt;a href="http://www.arrl.org/field-day"&gt;ARRL Field Day&lt;/a&gt; event.   We will be doing it in Palmyra.  A 2600 attendee (@pee) has offered to let us use land.  We are going to doing it purely off grid with generators, solar, and batteries.  The event runs from Saturday June 24th 2:00 PM (18:00 UTC) through Sunday June 25th 4:59 PM (20:59 UTC).  I (JustBill/KC2YPJ) will be there all night camping with the radios and working them.  I will have radios and antenna's.  All are welcome, bring family and have fun.  You are welcome to stay the night if you want as well just coordinate with me.   This is currently a bring your own food/refreshment event.  I'll try to have some water available for general public.&lt;/p&gt;

and some nylon rope (and a blow torch--spoiler: FIRE!), so I thought I'd post
it.  In fact, they're currently fighting over it in the yard as I try to post
the photos below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It holds easily a 50 lb. child jumping on it, and it's been up for at least 4
years now.  It's really rugged, and the key is the blow torch.  If you &lt;em&gt;cut&lt;/em&gt; a
hole in something, you make tiny cracks that can (and usually do) grow under
stress.  If you &lt;em&gt;melt&lt;/em&gt; a hole in the frisbee, two cool things happen that make
it really strong.  First, the plastic recedes from the hole to make a hard,
thick, strong rim.  Second, the rim is formed smooth and has no cracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how to make it.  You will need:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a strong plastic frisbee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a small blow torch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/2 " rope&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;several sizes of washers from 1/2 " up to 1.5"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wire cutters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instructions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put the frisbee on an outdoor fireproof surface, such as wet earth.  Think
   carefully about this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Holding the tip of the flame an inch or two away from the center of the
   frisbee, carefully melt a hole slightly less than 1/2" in diameter.  Remove
   the torch &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt;, because the hole will continue to grow slightly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let the frisbee cool for several minutes, while you hang the top of the
   rope, cut to the desired length with the cutters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put the rope through the hole in the frisbee, slide on a stack of washers
   and tie a figure-8 knot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you put on the washers, keep in mind that the purpose of the several sizes
is to make sure that the knot will not go through the smallest washer and the
largest washer is much larger than the hole in the frisbee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In no time, your kids will be fighting over it too!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

of these will become links in the future, as we add more detailed
descriptions about the projects... &amp;nbsp;(from left to right)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R.U.D.I. -&amp;nbsp;Rudimentary Utility Droid Intelligence from Bill&amp;nbsp;HK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raspberry Pi Backup Server - Carl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merlin-duino - Arduino Pro Mini and RGB LEDs in a 1980s Merlin game -
Scott&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amibian - RasPi running the UAE Amiga Emulator and our info slideshow
- Scott&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LED Interlock Sign - &amp;quot;Interlock&amp;quot; in bright friendly letters - Carl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walter - Motion Capture Puppet in Technic Lego, etc - Scott&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friendly Plastic - Low-melting-temperature moldable plastic - Joe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a brief recap of our experiences with the event...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We ran out of 160 fliers. &amp;nbsp;I should have printed more. &amp;nbsp;I just didn't
understand the volume of demand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One potentiometer failed hard on Walter. &amp;nbsp;His mouth wouldn't open
correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We ran out of fliers! &amp;nbsp;We had so much interest that all 160 fliers
were gone! &amp;nbsp;(see below for the solution key for the puzzles on the
back!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check-in and interaction with all event people was awesome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dan ran another great event! Thanks Dan!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had 4 members who were there for the full day, running demos and
talking with people. (Scott, Carl, Bill HK, Joe)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH! &amp;nbsp;:D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carl brought a delicious pastry for us all to share, and Bill brought
some refreshing water. THANK YOU!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, it was a great day, and I am super thankful to you all for
participating!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; On the back of our handout (before we ran out of them) were a
few puzzles to do. &amp;nbsp;In case you got stuck on them, or want to check your
work, here are the solutions:&lt;/p&gt;

raspberrypi. I covered going from a fresh pi to working network drive in
probably about 30 minutes of actual work along with 30 minutes of
talking about options for other things to do. There were 6 or so people
that came and for those people, and others that could not make it, here
are my notes on how to do this. It is not a recipe file with step by
step with commands that can be cut and pasted. This is because there are
lots of options and the values I use are going to be different that what
you will need on your network. These instructions will guide you through
this and tell you where to get things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a class="reference external" href="/"&gt;Interlock&lt;/a&gt;, JustBill handed me the old
controller board for a gutted 3D printer that he was rebuilding. &amp;quot;Do
whatever you want with this.&amp;quot; A close inspection of the board showed
that it had a main microcontroller of the ATmega 1280, which is the chip
used in older Arduino Megas. &amp;nbsp;The interface to USB however was an ATmega
8u2, which is the chip used in newer Arduino Megas, and you may also
know it from older Arduino Unos... modern Uno R3s use a 32u4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This board had custom firmware on it so that it didn't look like an
Arduino, or any sort of serial connection to the host computer it's
plugged into... so as-is, it was useless for general use as an Arduino;
taking advantage of the GUI and clicky-clicky programmer interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my thought was, it might be nice to have my own 'Mega for testing and
such. &amp;nbsp;Could this board be set up in a way that might make this process
and outcome easy? &amp;nbsp;Turns out it mostly was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original board got its power from a power terminls on the board,
24V. &amp;nbsp;It needed to power the stepper motors, and such so it needed to be
beefy. &amp;nbsp;This was dropped down to 5 and 3.3 on the board itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a USB B jack for connecting this to a host computer, which did
not have its 5V connected, so my thought was, what if i hooked up this
5V to the USB jack. &amp;nbsp;would that be enough to power the chips?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PBreWXxPx_U/VslDf1YJClI/AAAAAAAADdM/_a0TAusuQvk/s1600/FullSizeRender.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PBreWXxPx_U/VslDf1YJClI/AAAAAAAADdM/_a0TAusuQvk/s640/FullSizeRender.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added this jumper, which connects the +5 on the USB jack to the 5v bus
on the board, and plugged it in, and sure enough, it beeped and came to
life without its host power supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up would be reprogramming the micros to have the arduino bootloader
and code on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gPvnDEyf8aY/VslDp2zR3mI/AAAAAAAADdY/H0kpGhzhA98/s1600/IMG_0702.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="aligncenter" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gPvnDEyf8aY/VslDp2zR3mI/AAAAAAAADdY/H0kpGhzhA98/s640/IMG_0702.JPG" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hooked up my fairly cheesy Arduino D-15 (hacked stepper motor
controller) ISP to the 6 pin header, which thankfully was already
populated and labelled on the board! &amp;nbsp;I plugged it into the port
labelled &amp;quot;1280 ISP&amp;quot;, selected the Arduino Mega, with 1280 micro from the
Arduino 1.6.6 menus, selected Arduino ISP for the programmer, then
selected &amp;quot;load bootlader&amp;quot;. &amp;nbsp;In about a minute, it seemed to have
completed successfully.... if something didn't jive, it would have
spewed out sync or device errors to the screen... &amp;nbsp;Seemed good so far!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, was hooking it up to the jack labelled 8u2 ISP. &amp;nbsp;This was a little
trickier because I wasn't installing the bootloader (which the Arduino
IDE makes REALLY easy to do), but rather the secondary micro's firmware,
which basically was just a USB-Serial interface driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, I grabbed the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/tree/master/hardware/arduino/avr/firmwares/atmegaxxu2"&gt;8u2 code from github,
&amp;quot;MEGA-dfu_and_usbserial_combined.hex&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;,
and used the following command line (using a mixture of the code on that
page, with the parameters that my system used via the arduino IDE on my
Mac:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; ./avrdude -p at90usb82 -F -cstk500v1 -P/dev/cu.usbserial-A800czia
-b19200 -U flash:w:8u2.hex&amp;nbsp; -U lfuse:w:0xFF:m -U hfuse:w:0xD9:m -U
efuse:w:0xF4:m -U lock:w:0x0F:m
-C/Users/me/Library/Arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avrdude/6.0.1-arduino5/etc/avrdude.conf&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, it sets the CPU to at90usb82, uses the stk500v1 communications
protocol over the /dev/cu.usbserial driver, at 19200 baud.... it
programs the file 8u2.hex, sets fuses and sets other avrdude
configuration stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lots of text scrolling by from running that, I was able to drop a
program I was working on, onto it via the Arduino IDE directly, without
any problems at all! I set the port to the serial Mega, set the board to
&amp;quot;Arduino Mega&amp;quot;, cpu set at &amp;quot;Mega 1280&amp;quot;, clicked 'upload' and bam, fully
functional serial communications from the serial montior down through to
the '1280 on the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qazqVuRpJJo/VslDhbqR7WI/AAAAAAAADdc/_wIVTC-xUHA/s1600/IMG_0700.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qazqVuRpJJo/VslDhbqR7WI/AAAAAAAADdc/_wIVTC-xUHA/s640/IMG_0700.JPG" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoo! Free Arduino Mega for me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit: Here's the pinouts of stuff I beeped out. The number is the
digital (or Analog where applicable) pin on an Arduino Mega board. &amp;nbsp;So
digital 24 from Arduino corrolates to the &amp;quot;A Dir&amp;quot; pad on the board.&lt;/p&gt;

our first How Do I (HDI) related to security -- Burp Suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burp Suite is an HTTP/HTTPS proxy tool that can help you better
understand how a web application works. Designed for security, it
allows anyone to man-in-the-middle(MITM) web traffic, learn how a
web application works, and manipulate the traffic to see how the
application responds. Uses include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- debugging your web application to find why it doesn't work&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- identifying and exploiting security vulnerabilities&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- using it to inspect mobile traffic&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- answering the question ... &amp;quot;I wonder how that works&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seminar will start with a basic presentation about the Burp
Suite tools which is provided free to download.[0] The class will
walk through identifying vulnerabilities in a demo web site. All
attendees are expected to bring a laptop (Linux, OSX, or Windows) or
coordinate borrowing one before the workshop. If you have the ram to
support it, it's also recommended you run Vmware Player /
Workstation / Fusion on your system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're interested, please RSVP on the meetup site below. As always,
the workshop is open to the public for free. Please consider dropping a
few dollars in the donation bucket.&lt;/p&gt;

Interlock. &amp;nbsp;While this was done about a month back, full production cut
over happened earlier this week. &amp;nbsp;We were using a Meraki (Cisco) based
wireless system. &amp;nbsp;While nice, it had an annual renewal cost that was
unfortunately not sustainable for us. &amp;nbsp;After much research and
thoughtful debate, the decision was to use a Ubiquiti based wireless
system. Here are some action shots of the team installing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi all! I'd like to formally announce something that we've (kinda) been

&lt;p&gt;Hi all! I'd like to formally announce something that we've (kinda) been
working on for a little while now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE INTERLOCK SHELVES OF POTENTIAL AWESOME!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a library of sorts... &amp;nbsp;The idea is this: &amp;nbsp;If you want to try out
one of the dev kits that are there, you can&amp;nbsp;sign them out for your own
use. &amp;nbsp;Preferrably something that you will write a blog post for. ;) &amp;nbsp;but
even if you just want to sit down with one and mess with it for a week
or two, go for it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a list of what's currently available on the shelf:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://tinyurl.com/ks6gdtu"&gt;http://tinyurl.com/ks6gdtu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that list you will find an inventory ID that matches the ID on the
tag attached to each package. &amp;nbsp;You will also find a contact person who
may be able to help or at least point you in the right direction for
what these things are, how to use them, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, these items are borrow-only. &amp;nbsp;We are working on a way for these
items to be purchasable in the future. &amp;nbsp;For example, if you start using
one, and integrate it into your awesome project, we would like for there
to be a way for you to purchase it from the space. If there's something
you want to borrow, contact Scott to check it out. We'll eventually have
some sort of fancy computer-assisted self-operated inventory system, but
for now, we'll go with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are looking for more borrow-donations for the shelf! If you have
more, please let us know! &amp;nbsp;I'd like to make more Arduino boards
available, as well as modernish laptops and possibly retro computers for
people to borrow and play with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the near future, I will be setting up a laptop or two with a guest
account to be stored there for borrowing in case you want to work on
something at the space but forgot your own kit at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a CD case disguised as a &amp;quot;1997 MSDN Subscription&amp;quot; box.
&amp;nbsp;This is currently filled with empty disc sleeves, but in the future, it
will be populated with various install media for various old and new
hardware. &amp;nbsp;I will be bringing in disc media for some obsolete systems to
be put in there. I'd like for one of you Linux Master Craftspeople to
burn a copy or two of the current preferred
desktop/server/32/64/whatever discs to be stored in there. &amp;nbsp;We will
catalog the contents as things get added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He had already popped the back off at some point, so I just popped it
back off again. &amp;nbsp;The USB port had to be desoldered from the board.
&amp;nbsp;Little did I know that it also was glued down. &amp;nbsp;That made it a bit
difficult to remove from the board&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2015/04/CCCTy4iWAAMfjrm.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="2015-04-07 20.49.45" class="wp-image-1947 aligncenter" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2015/04/2015-04-07-20.49.45-300x225.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a lot of extra solder, and some leverage with the tweezers, I did
manage to get it off. &amp;nbsp;Some work with the vacuum pump desolderer, some
desoldering braid, and cleanup with rubbing alcohol and the mainboard
was ready for the replacement part. &amp;nbsp;(Sharpie for scale)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2015/04/2015-04-07-21.25.38.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="2015-04-07 21.25.38" class="wp-image-1948 aligncenter" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2015/04/2015-04-07-21.25.38-300x225.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting it lined up so that all of the pads matched up and that the
connector's opening would line up with the case was a little bit tricky.
&amp;nbsp;I soldered this one&amp;nbsp;on with too-large of a tip by doing the &amp;quot;flooding
the pads&amp;quot; method. Then excess solder was removed with some braid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2015/04/2015-04-07-21.43.35.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="2015-04-07 21.43.35" class="wp-image-1949 aligncenter" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2015/04/2015-04-07-21.43.35-225x300.jpg" style="width: 277px; height: 369px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I fully reassembled it, I tried out the jack, and it worked! I
filed down and smoothed out the edge to remove any broken frame bits, to
fix the damage done the first time it was opened, and powered it on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2015/04/2015-04-07-21.48.01.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="CCCTy4iWAAMfjrm" class="wp-image-1946 aligncenter" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2015/04/CCCTy4iWAAMfjrm-300x225.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The best way to test it, and the best way to go a bit
insane is to get a chorus of Talking Ginger and other talking animals
going... They were repeating each other, degrading the sound more and
more with each repetition... We were pretty punchy at the end of the
evening...&lt;/p&gt;

here... &amp;lt;http://day.arduino.cc&amp;gt;`__*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be running an Arduino project challenge contest! Using an
Arduino (or related micro), along with any resources and tools in the
Interlock space, and/or materials you bring yourself,&amp;nbsp;what cool thing
can you build? &amp;nbsp;Some old hardware (printers, scanners, misc parts) will
be available to take apart... Judging will happen at 9:30, points will
be awarded for usefulness, niftiness, artistic quality, and technical
depth... &amp;nbsp; The winner(s) will get something, to be determined. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the day, we'll have the doors open for all who want to visit
and participate, or just check us and our space out. We'll be around all
day to help you with your Arduino project, or get help from you on our
projects! ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:00 am - Doors open, Coffee will be available, get settled in, get to
know each other. Project workshop time as well (throughout the day)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11:00 am - Intro to Arduino - What it is, how to use it, some basic
interfacing with buttons and lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noon - Lunch! &amp;nbsp;Sub sandwiches and beverages will be available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1:00 pm - Project Circus - show off your project. &amp;nbsp;casual presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2:00 pm - Arduino Communications - How to get your computer to talk with
the Ardy, and get them to talk with devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3:00 pm - Analog interfacing with Alex - how to work with other kinds of
peripherals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4:00 pm - &amp;nbsp;Project Circus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5:00 pm - Dinner! Pizza and beverages will be available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:00 pm - Workshop Time (or TBD)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:00 pm - Workshop Time&amp;nbsp;(or TBD)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8:00 pm - Workshop Time&amp;nbsp;(or TBD)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9:00 pm - Project Challenge voting! (at 9:30)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:00 pm - End of the event. &amp;nbsp;We'll probably stick around for a while
anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

rearranged things a bit. &amp;nbsp;The goal was to have more workspace for the
Arduino Day workshops, and to have things on display that were more
representative of who we are. &amp;nbsp;We installed a few shelves to store
projects-in-development (that don't fit or we don't want to put them in
our lockers or offices), as well as to show off some completed projects.
&amp;nbsp;The shelves are a bit bare right now, but we'll fill them up soon
enough! &amp;nbsp;Here are some pics to show what the place is like right now...&lt;/p&gt;

that gives the BBB a pretty&amp;nbsp;useful feature; charging and operating off
of li-po batteries.&amp;nbsp;If you look at the BBB board, you will see 4
through-holes behind the 5v plug. These are break outs for the PMIC and
can be used to&amp;nbsp;hook up to a battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2015/03/IMAG0734.jpg.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img alt="beaglebone with sparkfun battery" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1906" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2015/03/IMAG0734.jpg-300x170.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 170px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a battery connected to your board gives you the ability to do
things like making a UPS for you beaglebone so in the case of a power
loss, it can politely shut-down, run a custom command, or just continue
running for as long as the battery can charge it.&lt;img alt="bbb_pinouts" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1907" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2015/03/bbb_pinouts-e1425329803523-267x300.jpg" style="width: 267px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="power"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most of the use cases, you're going to find a lithium&amp;nbsp;polymer that
can produce around 3.7V which is under the BBB's 5v requirement. 3.7V
will work fine to power the board but of course your 5V USB port will
not work while on the
battery.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8483"&gt;Sparkfun&lt;/a&gt;has a
few nice ones that have the voltage protection circuits built in&amp;nbsp;to help
limit the risk you brick your li-po.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="configuration"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 4 pins we're talking about:&lt;strong&gt;|bbb-batt-srm|&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TP5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TP6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TP7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TP8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see in the diagram what each pin-out is. Li-po's are riskier
than some batteries because they're&amp;nbsp;known to explode&amp;nbsp;in some cases of
over powering. A temperature sensor that is designed to check how hot
the battery is getting and decide how to handle it, is built into the
PMIC in case your battery doesn't have this capability already(many do).
The directions below are going to show you how to jump this temperatur
check with a 10k resistor, which is not recommended if you value your
home or hackerspace. If you don't trust the battery you're charging, I'd
suggest looking into accurately reading the temperature from your
battery. My Sparkfun batteries do no break out the temperature sensor so
this wasn't plausible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="directions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Directions&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jumper pins TP5 to TP6 (or use an SMT zero ohm resistor)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;connect a 10K resistor between TP7 and TP8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install a JST connector on TP6 and TP8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connect your battery into the JST connector&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a little luck and the correct battery, you should be in business.
You'll need to let your battery charge before you try and yank the power
cable from it. In the mean time, you can query the status of the battery
via the i2cget command built into the OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="testing"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PMIC is accessible using I2C and the builti-n OS for BBB has a
simple command line interface to query its state. The following command
will tell you whether or not battery is plugged in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`` i2cget -y -f 0 0x24 0xA``&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will return information that contains this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
0 device 0x24
On battery power only? 0
STATUS: r[0xa]=0x88
Push Button = 0
USB Power = 0
AC Power = 1
CHARGER: r[0x3]=0x1
Active (charging) = 1
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Active&amp;quot; refers to whether it can recognize the battery you have plugged
in. &amp;nbsp;You can also read this state to detect a power failure and
automatically failover. If you're using the default OS for the
Beaglebone Black (the one that comes pre-installed), the OS will
automatically shut itself down in the case of a power loss. You'll want
to either install another OS, or disable that service if you'd like to
change how long the battery should stay online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="more-info"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More info&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decent amount of research went into this simple project. There are a
ton of warnings and caveats that I'm not going to cram into this blog
post (i2c address is read only, pin-outs are not a standard size, beware
of jumping the resistor next to the pins). You can find out more
information here:&lt;/p&gt;

Defined Radio (SDR)
workshop&lt;/a&gt;.
The goal of which is to provide introductory support to people learning
about SDR's as well as let some of the more seasoned folk work on their
projects. We've talk to a lot of people lately about what an SDR is and
why we have a workshop for it so I thought&amp;nbsp;I'd review why they're fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is an SDR?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike some&amp;nbsp;radio equipment which only provides a small range of
frequencies you can transmit and receive on, SDR's&amp;nbsp;let you use&amp;nbsp;a single
device, and control their frequency from very low (&amp;lt;100Mhz) to very high
(2.4GHz+).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2015/02/hdsdr11.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="hdsdr1[1]" class="size-medium wp-image-1902 aligncenter" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2015/02/hdsdr11-300x169.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 169px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past,&amp;nbsp;if you wanted to listen in on a certain frequency, say your
garage door opener for example, you'd have to buy a piece of hardware
that runs at that frequency -- in this case it's often 434MHz. Now for
as little as $20, you can buy a device that can read your &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rtl-sdr.com/using-rtl-sdr-ti-chronos-rf-wristwatch-copy-garage-door-opener/"&gt;garage door
opener at
433Mhz&lt;/a&gt;,
listen to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rtl-sdr.com/video-tutorial-hak5-gnu-radio-fm-radio-receiver/"&gt;local FM radio
station&lt;/a&gt;
at 90.5Mhz, or &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rtl-sdr.com/adsb-aircraft-radar-with-rtl-sdr/"&gt;track airplanes at
1090Mhz&lt;/a&gt;.
This lets you play with different frequencies and see what's being
transmitted. You may be surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also lets you learn about the basics of RF: electronics,
antennas,&amp;nbsp;ways to decode a signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workshop is open to the public; non-members are welcome as
always.&amp;nbsp;Feel free to drop a comment on the meetup page if&amp;nbsp;you're
interested but have some questions.&lt;/p&gt;

Interlock has entertained guests from&amp;nbsp;all over. Sometimes travelers will
email us saying they are doing a tour of hackerspaces in the region and
wanted to stop in for a night. When we're available, we're happy to
entertain at the space and even take them out for a drink.&amp;nbsp;I remember
one&amp;nbsp;visit from a group travelling first&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;New York City (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.nycresistor.com/"&gt;NYC
Resistor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.alphaonelabs.com/"&gt;Alpha One
Labs&lt;/a&gt;), going up through Syracuse (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sig315.org/"&gt;SIG
315&lt;/a&gt;), to Rochester (&lt;a class="reference external" href="#"&gt;Interlock&lt;/a&gt;) and
ending up in Toronto (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://hacklab.to/"&gt;Hacklab&lt;/a&gt;). Our members
have visited spaces all over the country; Florida, Texas, California,
North Carolina, and Washington DC are a few that I can remember. There
is even a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/passport"&gt;hackerspace
passport&lt;/a&gt; that Noisebridge
started where you can get it stamped at the various hackerspaces that
you visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Myself and another member recently visited Iceland for New Years for
just over a week and the day after we landed, we jumped on the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hakkavelin.is/"&gt;Hakkavélin&lt;/a&gt; IRC channel to reach out to see
when open hours were and if we could arrange a visit.&amp;nbsp;While the space
wasn't opened due to the holidays,&amp;nbsp;Sigurður óskarsson&amp;nbsp;was kind enough to
meet us at the hackerspace to take us out to a cafe in town.&amp;nbsp;We talked
shop&amp;nbsp;a bit, discussing projects people were working on and history of
each others' spaces, along with operational details like how they
handled membership and how much they charged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned about their &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hakkavelin.is/post/74269934436/the-evolutionary-stages-of-the-door-bot"&gt;door
system&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;which
consisted of a full computer sitting outside of the space controlling
the door lock. In order to get in, you have to figure out how to use the
console in a hackery way. As I understand it, there's also an IRC bot
which controls this door if you message the right user. Located inside
the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=16/64.1243/-21.9251"&gt;University of
Reykjavik&lt;/a&gt;,
the group&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;just outside of the downtown area in South Reykjavik. With
only four hours of light this time of year, I wasn't able to get a good
look at the university but the buildings I saw were pretty with huge
glass walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have never considered looking up a local hackerspace on your
vacation or business trip, I would strongly recommend you consider it
next time. It's a great way to meet like-minded folk in different
locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's important for all of us to know what projects are underway at
Interlock. &amp;nbsp;Many of us have particular
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4ttVP2cyK4"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;or
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vxjunkies"&gt;equipment&lt;/a&gt; that could help a
project move along, or we might simply be interested in learning more by
collaborating. &amp;nbsp;While it's great to get together and talk about plans in
person each month, it's impossible to get all of us together at the same
time with any regularity, and sometimes inspiration hits at weird times.
&amp;nbsp;Having an easy mechanism to jot down ideas, track the progress of
projects, and collaborate with others is helping us be more effective
and creative already, and the detailed records of a project evolving
should&amp;nbsp;help us
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://trello.com/c/wMeVgm6Y/49-trello-blog-post"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;with more
regularly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please feel free to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://trello.com/b/dsfhrqxR/projects"&gt;browse&amp;nbsp;our public projects
board&lt;/a&gt; to see what we're up
to between our monthly meetings. &amp;nbsp;If you're an Interlock member and
would like access, create a Trello account and then let Joe or another
board member know your username.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;About Girl Develop It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Girl Develop It is a nonprofit organization that was launched in New
York in 2010. The initial goal was to draw more women to the development
community and to provide judgment-free learning opportunities through
teaching one another. Girl Develop It has since grown within the vision
of creating a network of empowered women who feel confident in their
abilities to code and build beautiful web and mobile applications. The
organization is currently making an impact in 33 cities around the US
and Canada with 10 new chapters, including Rochester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find more information about their class here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been getting into making stained glass pieces, as I've been taking
a class at the Rochester Memorial Art Gallery. &amp;nbsp;One of the tools they
have available there is a light box, which I have used to make the
template for the macaw piece I'm making. &amp;nbsp;I used it to help me adapt a
pattern I found online into something that better suits my needs. &amp;nbsp;I
traced it, then retraced that sketch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The light box also works well to see how things look with light behind
them, however it's not something I can use a lot for this, since my
project is a couple dozen pieces of glass and we have to share the light
box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the recycle pile at work was a couple of old, broken laptops. &amp;nbsp;I
snagged two of them; one with an LED backlight, and one with a CCFT
backlight. &amp;nbsp;I thought that the LED one would be easier to get working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over at &lt;a class="reference external" href="/"&gt;Interlock&lt;/a&gt;, I tore apart the
screens, tossing out the LCD panel, so I was left with just the light
source, light guide, diffusion screens, and control circuitry. &amp;nbsp;Its
control/driver board also managed the LCD itself. &amp;nbsp;There were many test
points on the back, so I applied power to the &amp;quot;LED PWR&amp;quot; pin, ground to a
ground point, then about +5 volts to the BLEN (assuming it to be
&amp;quot;backlight enable&amp;quot;) as well as the &amp;quot;PWM&amp;quot; test point. After futzing with
it for a little bit, I gave up and focused efforts on the CCFT-based
one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slightly larger CCFT (Fluorescent) based one had a single board that
connected to the backlight tube through standard white/pink
silicone-insulated wiring. &amp;nbsp;The board itself had one tiny connector on
one side with a few pins that seemed to have obvious use. &amp;nbsp;V+, which
assumably powers the backlight circuitry, should be connected to +5 or
maybe +12. &amp;nbsp;GND, which of course is ground. Then two other connections
&amp;quot;EN&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;CTRL&amp;quot;, which I guessed to be &amp;quot;Enable&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Control&amp;quot;. &amp;nbsp;A guess
would be to tie these to a logic &amp;quot;high&amp;quot; which might maybe enable the
thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I connected just the V+ and GND to a power supply, and applied power.
&amp;nbsp;Ranging from 0v up through 12v yielded no results. I connected the
other two logic lines to power too, and started ramping up the power.
&amp;nbsp;At around 7v, the backlight flickered on, but then wouldn't do anything
until I brought the power back to 0v, and then back up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a hunch, I figured that the backlight needs a higher voltage, and the
logic stays at TTL levels. &amp;nbsp;Applying the same power to both would give a
possible point between the two where both kinda worked, which is where I
saw the flicker. &amp;nbsp;I hacked together two power supplies, with grounds
tied together, 5v from one power brick, and the V+ to the variable
supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9We5elFk1J8/VFpB9JnXiDI/AAAAAAAAC7w/UR087-rhETA/s1600/2014-11-04%2B22.18.15.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F1.bp.blogspot.com%2F-9We5elFk1J8%2FVFpB9JnXiDI%2FAAAAAAAAC7w%2FUR087-rhETA%2Fs1600%2F2014-11-04%252B22.18.15.jpg&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ramped up the voltage, and sure enough, it would get dim around 7v,
then go full brightness around 12v. &amp;nbsp;It seemed to use about 300mA to
drive it too. Good to know. &amp;nbsp;I found a 12v power brick and.. it would
light for about 20 seconds then power itself off. &amp;nbsp;The 12v brick put out
18v.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I eventually found a brick that worked, so i hooked up two supplies, a
5v and a 12v and it was stable and bright. &amp;nbsp;Next would be the task to
put in a 5v regulator to provide the 5v it needs, so i can run it all on
one single power supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-stT0iwcG9FE/VFpFzcS57OI/AAAAAAAAC8E/5trk7YF5Vsc/s1600/main-qimg-d1e728f2f684a47d10b25686f66e93f9.gif"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F4.bp.blogspot.com%2F-stT0iwcG9FE%2FVFpFzcS57OI%2FAAAAAAAAC8E%2F5trk7YF5Vsc%2Fs1600%2Fmain-qimg-d1e728f2f684a47d10b25686f66e93f9.gif&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="width: 320px; height: 122px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple circuit using a 7805 and two capacitors later, and I have 12v
in, and a backlight lit! &amp;nbsp;I wrapped the circuit in tape (purple because
it was there), hooked it up to a power connector, and reassembled the
case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qaXCEb0O6bA/VFpB9O9cu6I/AAAAAAAAC70/f4be5tcJKVU/s1600/2014-11-04%2B22.59.53.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F2.bp.blogspot.com%2F-qaXCEb0O6bA%2FVFpB9O9cu6I%2FAAAAAAAAC70%2Ff4be5tcJKVU%2Fs1600%2F2014-11-04%252B22.59.53.jpg&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best of all, it all managed to fit within the old plastics. Huzzah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I just need to put something on the diffusers to protect them from
cut glass, maybe a piece of plexi, or even a large Ziplock or plastic
wrap, and I'll be set!&lt;/p&gt;

off, we can adjust our dues so that a portion is for membership, and a
portion is a donation for the write off. If this confuses you, don't
worry, we'll take care of the hard work for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="next-steps"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're still in the process of updating our&amp;nbsp;system for accepting
donations, changing how dues are accepted,&amp;nbsp;and working on taking
advantage of our status, but in the mean time if you have any questions,
you can email info at interlockroc.org.&lt;/p&gt;

nature’s most fascinating phenomena. In less than a millisecond, a
kilometers-long plasma channel sinks an unimaginable electrical current
from a cloud to the ground, unleashing vast amounts of energy in a very
short period of time. Nearby observers will see a brilliant flash of
light and hear (and feel!) a shockwave of thunder from the superheating
of the air surrounding the bolt. However, did you know that the effects
of lightning are also detectable as radio signals across thousands of
kilometers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of researchers led by Prof. Dr. Egon Wanke of
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/62539"&gt;Düsseldorf&lt;/a&gt;, Germany,
started the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.blitzortung.org/"&gt;Blitzortung&lt;/a&gt; project a few
years ago. Blitzortung is a worldwide, non-commercial, crowd-sourced
Time-of-Arrival (TOA) lightning detection and location network. Around
the world, hundreds of stations listen for the tell-tale electromagnetic
signature of a lightning stroke in the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_low_frequency"&gt;VLF&lt;/a&gt; range
(roughly 3 to 30 kHz). When a stroke is detected, each station records
the characteristics of the signal and a precise
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt;
timestamp, and then transmits this information to a central server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a probable lightning stroke is detected by multiple stations, the
server uses the timestamps and the speed of light to locate the
lightning strike. If station A detected the stroke at time t&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;,
and station B detected the stroke at time t&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, then the
lightning stroke had to occur somewhere along a hyperbolic curve, as a
time difference of 100 microseconds corresponds to a distance difference
of 30 kilometers. Compute curves for at least three pairs of stations
and they will hopefully all meet at exactly one point. This is the
essence of
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_of_arrival"&gt;Time-of-Arrival&lt;/a&gt;
location finding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to this summer, the nearest station was about 400 km from
Rochester, outside of Philadelphia. This station was still able to
detect a significant number of lightning strokes from Rochester and
beyond! That’s because lightning produces an extremely strong, extremely
low-frequency electromagnetic pulse which bounces between the ground and
the ionosphere for thousands of kilometers, like an atmospheric
waveguide. However, two Rochester-area stations went live in late
summer, providing additional coverage for storms in the Northeastern US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of those stations is in Interlock Rochester’s space in the
Hungerford building. It consists of a custom-built magnetic loop
antenna, a Blitzortung amplifier board, and a Blitzortung controller
board. As of this writing, it has been active for two weeks and has
detected 30,282 lightning strokes, the longest of which was 4,350 km
away! This is despite our antenna being located inside of an industrial
building on the outskirts of downtown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Props to W2NED and the rest of the crew who built &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://rags.rochesterham.org/e-RAGS/RAG_September_2014.pdf"&gt;the other
station&lt;/a&gt;,
located in Naples, New York.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total costs were approximately:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blitzortung PCB and parts (amplifier, controller): €120&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Antenna parts from Lowes: $20 (??)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;STM32F4DISCOVERY ARM board from Mouser: $15&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future improvements include &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:452968"&gt;3D-printing an enclosure for the
amplifier&lt;/a&gt; (and perhaps the
controller) and finding a better location to hang the antenna. While
we’re approaching the winter months and won’t see much lightning until
the spring, we’ve still got
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundersnow"&gt;thundersnow&lt;/a&gt; to look
forward to!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier, these pages addressed this problem &lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}/raspberry-pi-macgyver.rst"&gt;using VNC to provide a
remote Raspberry Pi
display&lt;/a&gt;
(eg, from your laptop).&amp;nbsp; It's a good approach, well documented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternately, with a little bit of prep work, perhaps using the above
technique to get everything set up to start, you can program your Pi to
announce its IP address via audio using text-to-speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_1665&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot;
width=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot;]&lt;img alt="earbuds" class="wp-image-1665 size-medium" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2014/06/earbuds-300x225.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 225px;" /&gt; Much cheaper output than a HDMI-capable
monitor[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essence of this trick is to install a text-to-speech program, create
a small script to extract the IP address, to pass that address to the
text-to-speech program, and then finally to configure the initialization
scripts to run the readout script shortly after booting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm working with a rev B Raspberry Pi running Raspbian, but the approach
should be generalizable to any distro for which a TTS package is
available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, set up the Raspberry Pi with keyboard, mouse, wired networking,
and video, either HDMI or analog.&amp;nbsp; If you use analog, you may need to
increase the font size considerably even to be able to read the screen.
Open a terminal and install festival:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;sudo &lt;span class="pre"&gt;apt-get&lt;/span&gt; install festival&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, if you haven't already done so, create a &lt;strong&gt;bin&lt;/strong&gt; directory in your
home directory to hold this and other small local scripts and programs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;mkdir ~/bin&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, open your favorite editor to create a small script file containing
the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`` #!/usr/bin/bash /usr/bin/amixer cset numid=3 1 /sbin/ifconfig | /bin/grep -A3 eth0 | /bin/grep inet | /usr/bin/tr ':' ' ' | /usr/bin/cut -d-f 13 | /usr/bin/festival --tts``&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be careful if you try to copy-and-paste that that a) you get the
single-quotes carried over into the right place and b) that you don't
have any space or tab or other otherwise hard-to-see non-newline
whitespace characters at the end of the lines with backslashes. If
either error crops up, edit to fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(NB: ifconfig is a bit old school. Interlock HAM and rally enthusiast
HoopyCat points out that to be fully kids-these-days compliant, one
should use the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;ip&lt;/tt&gt; command.)*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save the file as &lt;strong&gt;/home/pi/bin/ippixvox.sh&lt;/strong&gt; and give it execute
permissions with &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;chmod a+x /home/pi/bin/ippixvox.sh&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;You can now test it by typing&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;`` ~/bin/ippivox.sh``&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;into your terminal with a speaker or earphones plugged in. If you are
connected to a network (and if not, how did you get festival
downloaded?) you should hear the IPv4 address read off. If not, run
ifconfig to check to make sure you do have IPv4 address (&amp;quot;inet&amp;quot;)
assigned, and that it is assigned to eth0. If it's assigned to something
other than eth0, modify the script above to suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Finally, to make this work at boot time, open the file&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;**
/etc/init.d/rc.local**&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in an editor and add at the very bottom this one line&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;/home/pi/bin/ippivox.sh&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save, reboot, and listen for the IP address to be read to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it works, then you can dispense with attaching a video output device
when it comes time to hack on the Pi in favor of just logging in from a
machine elsewhere on the same network using ssh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it useful to play a short alert announcement before the IP
address is read. I also use a second TTS program, flite, both to give me
a second shot at hearing the IP and also in hopes that I'll be better
able to understand at least one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My more lengthy approach to this is documented in the following github
gist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/deejoe/ce7984f94b91bdb6b48e"&gt;https://gist.github.com/deejoe/ce7984f94b91bdb6b48e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

happen with any 3D Printer. However, the 3Doodler is exceptionally easy
to get going again by giving the filament a gentle nudge. The Filament
Nudger is a hack to reduce the number of times the 3Doodler stalls or
jams by providing a continuously nudging force on the filament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_1658&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;518&amp;quot;]&lt;img alt="Nudger without handle" class="wp-image-1658" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2014/05/Nudger-without-handle.jpg" style="width: 518px; height: 455px;" /&gt; 3Doodler with Filament Nudger[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nudger works with or without the Phaser Handle described in a
previous blog :&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}/how-to-3d-print-a-handle-and-trigger-for-the-3doodler-and-to-make-it-look-like-a-phaser.rst"&gt;How to 3D-print a Handle and Trigger for the 3Doodler
(and to make it look like a Phaser)
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;
If you have access to a 3D printer, you can build a Nudger yourself by
downloading these files on
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:322553/#files"&gt;Thingiverse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_1659&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;518&amp;quot;]&lt;img alt="With handle" class="wp-image-1659" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2014/05/With-handle.jpg" style="width: 518px; height: 296px;" /&gt; 3Doodler with Phaser Handle and Filament Nudger[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The automatic Filament Nudger was designed to be powered by a pair of
rubber bands,&amp;nbsp; and it is cocked by pulling back on the Filament Grabber
mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_1654&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot;
width=&amp;quot;518&amp;quot;]&lt;img alt="Cocking the Nudger" class="wp-image-1654" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2014/05/Cocking-the-Nudger.png" style="width: 518px; height: 328px;" /&gt; Cocking the Filament Nudger[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Grabber works like a 1-way clutch, pulling the filament toward the
3Doodler but releasing the filament when pulled in the other direction
or when the Grabber bumps the back of the 3Doodler. The force applied by
the rubber bands is effective in keeping the extruder going, but is not
strong enough to prevent the filament retraction which conveniently
keeps the 3Doodler from oozing between extrusions like a glue gun does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_1656&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot;

Filament Nudger works with filament provided by 3Doodler[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When used with the filament sticks provided by 3Doodler, the Filament
Nudger has the benefits of (1) reducing extruder stalls and also (2) it
lets you install a new stick any time after the trailing end of a stick
disappears into the 3Doodler. Without the Nudger, a new stick may fall
out when the 3Doodler is tipped upward before the new stick is engaged,
and this can be annoying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a hinge pin for the Grabber with small piece of filament, and put
button heads on the pin with the 3Doodler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="2 Zip-tie Frame" class="wp-image-1649 alignright" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2014/05/2-Zip-tie-Frame.png" style="width: 414px; height: 241px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attach the Frame to the 3Doodler with a zip-tie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="3 Insert Skewers" class="wp-image-1650 alignright" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2014/05/3-Insert-Skewers.png" style="width: 414px; height: 287px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cut (2) 1/8 inch bamboo skewers to 7 inch lengths and insert them into
the Frame (drilling out the holes if they are too tight, locking them in
with small nails if they are too loose).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="4 Insert Grabber" class="wp-image-1651 alignright" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2014/05/4-Insert-Grabber.png" style="width: 414px; height: 270px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insert the Grabber onto the filament and skewers as shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="5 Insert Filament Guide" class="wp-image-1652 alignright" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2014/05/5-Insert-Filament-Guide.png" style="width: 414px; height: 268px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insert Filament Guide over skewers and filament as shown (drilling out
the holes if they are too tight, locking them in with small nails if
they are too loose).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="6 Hook rubber bands" class="wp-image-1653 alignright" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2014/05/6-Hook-rubber-bands.png" style="width: 414px; height: 282px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hook rubber bands over Grabber and attach them to Frame as shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;In our next post we will show how to use the 3Doodler to hack up
accessories for itself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to package up my JAMMA test rig so that I could demo Crazy

&lt;p&gt;I decided to package up my JAMMA test rig so that I could demo Crazy
Otto at Rochester BarCamp for today. &amp;nbsp;My design was basically a box that
would house the entire thing, with a nice control panel for player 1.
&amp;nbsp;As you can see in the above image, I have the A/V cable going to an
external monitor. &amp;nbsp;Broken out on the box are player 1 and 2 start, coin
1, and player 1 controls - joystick and 3 buttons. &amp;nbsp;On the right side of
the box are the three &amp;quot;coin box&amp;quot; controls -- Test, Tilt, and Service,
for testing those functions of the board. &amp;nbsp;Also on that side is a nice
handle to help it be portable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a continuation of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://geodesicsphere.blogspot.com/2014/02/updating-my-jamma-test-rig.html"&gt;part 1, where I updated the AV connections
of the
rig&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nDP_92M4YFM/U1M0gHY_jeI/AAAAAAAACwE/cfeMOS1ekec/s1600/2014-04-08+21.33.00.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F4.bp.blogspot.com%2F-nDP_92M4YFM%2FU1M0gHY_jeI%2FAAAAAAAACwE%2FcfeMOS1ekec%2Fs1600%2F2014-04-08%2B21.33.00.jpg&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="width: 300px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is about the extent of blueprints I have for this. &amp;nbsp;I knew I needed
14&amp;quot; depth for the monitor, and that it needed about a 2&amp;quot; rise from the
back to the front to put it at a good angle. &amp;nbsp;I wanted it to be 18&amp;quot;
wide, and 24&amp;quot; deep. &amp;nbsp;That would give enough room for a game board inside
of it, as well as for a decent sized control panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vj7FRtuwaoI/U1M2uUih-PI/AAAAAAAACwY/jM8BsjZHRrs/s1600/2014-04-08+23.19.01.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F2.bp.blogspot.com%2F-vj7FRtuwaoI%2FU1M2uUih-PI%2FAAAAAAAACwY%2FjM8BsjZHRrs%2Fs1600%2F2014-04-08%2B23.19.01.jpg&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started by cutting a sheet of plywood I've had in our garage
for a while. &amp;nbsp;I also built the control panel using spare parts I had.
&amp;nbsp;Thanks to members of Interlock to help me use the table saw, suggest
tools and offer bits of wood. &amp;nbsp;:D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some standard microswitch buttons, and a nice ball-top leaf-switch
joystick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cydJ39iIQvw/U1M3gCeS2fI/AAAAAAAACwo/1n4QMzmT-YE/s1600/2014-04-13+00.02.24.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image5" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F1.bp.blogspot.com%2F-cydJ39iIQvw%2FU1M3gCeS2fI%2FAAAAAAAACwo%2F1n4QMzmT-YE%2Fs1600%2F2014-04-13%2B00.02.24.jpg&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic construction is that I glued some cleats on the inside of each
side. Then the back, bottom, front and control panel will be screwed to
it. &amp;nbsp;After that, it looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3K5F7U_IA6Q/U1M4kGWWFKI/AAAAAAAACw4/LiOxY_9eV34/s1600/2014-04-15+23.18.31.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image6" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F3.bp.blogspot.com%2F-3K5F7U_IA6Q%2FU1M4kGWWFKI%2FAAAAAAAACw4%2FLiOxY_9eV34%2Fs1600%2F2014-04-15%2B23.18.31.jpg&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FAKRknjQsgQ/U1M4l9zfgjI/AAAAAAAACxA/0r_V0GPYYVg/s1600/2014-04-15+23.18.51.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image7" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F2.bp.blogspot.com%2F-FAKRknjQsgQ%2FU1M4l9zfgjI%2FAAAAAAAACxA%2F0r_V0GPYYVg%2Fs1600%2F2014-04-15%2B23.18.51.jpg&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also cut and drilled a small metal bracket to hold the power supply in
place, which you can see in the above. &amp;nbsp;The coin 1 button on the front
has a 12v light in it. &amp;nbsp;The old P2 controller is still attached to the
JAMMA rig, in case I want to test/play 2 player games. &amp;nbsp;You can also see
the 1 1/4&amp;quot; fine thread drywall screws holding it together here. &amp;nbsp;From
here, the only change is that I painted it, stinking up our garage in
the process. heh. &amp;nbsp;The top lid hooks under the control panel, and has a
cleat in the back to keep it from sliding off the back. &amp;nbsp;There's a
single screw to hold it in place, and to let it be carried withot the
contents falling out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eZu5wH69luQ/U1M5zDFWpfI/AAAAAAAACxM/jCR3iqEw1F4/s1600/2014-04-19+16.57.49.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image8" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F2.bp.blogspot.com%2F-eZu5wH69luQ%2FU1M5zDFWpfI%2FAAAAAAAACxM%2FjCR3iqEw1F4%2Fs1600%2F2014-04-19%2B16.57.49.jpg&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="width: 480px; height: 640px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great thing about this thing is that it's easy to tote this thing
around to play/demo games and such. &amp;nbsp;It takes two trips since the
monitor is cumbersome, and the box itself is pretty heavy, but it's
SIGNIFICANTLY easier than toting around a full arcade cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reference, here's the JAMMA pinout standard: &amp;nbsp;(Most games since the
late 1980s use this or a variant of it -- for example, Neo Geo adds
additional buttons on unused pins, Rampart uses a trackball on the
joystick pins, and Mortal Kombat has additional buttons on another
interface harness.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-f-lfNHovg-o/U1M7AMoGZiI/AAAAAAAACxY/RYRHymBXE88/s1600/2014-04-15+21.53.29.gif"&gt;&lt;img alt="image9" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F4.bp.blogspot.com%2F-f-lfNHovg-o%2FU1M7AMoGZiI%2FAAAAAAAACxY%2FRYRHymBXE88%2Fs1600%2F2014-04-15%2B21.53.29.gif&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power and ground at the top portion are wired directly to the old PC
power supply. &amp;nbsp;Coin counters and lockout coils are not wired to
anything. &amp;nbsp;The speaker wires are broken out to a RCA plug, and the Video
(RGB,Sync) are out to a DIN connector, as seen in the previous post.
&amp;nbsp;Service, Tilt, and Test are wired to the three switches on the side of
the box. &amp;nbsp;Coin switch 1, and the two start buttons are on the control
panel, as are all of the 1P controls (on the right).&lt;/p&gt;

The company is now taking orders.&amp;nbsp; Last summer it was a &amp;quot;crowd-funded&amp;quot;
Kickstarter project, and we invested in it.&amp;nbsp; Our reward for sponsoring
this clever invention was to receive our very own pre-production device
in January.&amp;nbsp;It is kind of a cross between a hot-glue gun and a 3D
printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2014/03/Doodler-1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Doodler 1" class="aligncenter wp-image-1635" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2014/03/Doodler-1.png" style="width: 518px; height: 290px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike a glue-gun that melts a stick of rubbery plastic to glue things
together, the 3Doodler can melt a 3mm filament of ABS (a kind of plastic
that many things are made of) and extrudes it into a softened web-like
thread that can draw up off of the paper in the open air and into almost
any shape you can imagine.&amp;nbsp; While it is intended&amp;nbsp;to be used for making
plastic objects by drawing 3-dimensional doodles, we use it primarily to
fix plastic objects that have broken or to hack plastic things by adding
features to them.&amp;nbsp; But more about that in a later blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we would like to tell you how the team of &lt;strong&gt;MacGyvrBot and Skip&lt;/strong&gt;
have found a way to make this great product even better!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2014/03/Doodler-2.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Doodler 2" class="aligncenter wp-image-1636" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2014/03/Doodler-2.png" style="width: 373px; height: 386px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used Tinkercad to hack-up a model for a Handle and Trigger mechanism,
and then we published the design on
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:267091%20"&gt;Thingiverse&lt;/a&gt; so that
anyone with access to a 3D printer can download the .stl files and make
a &lt;strong&gt;Phaser Handle for 3Doodler&lt;/strong&gt; of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or you can just click these links to download the 3 files&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/download:484759%20%20"&gt;Handle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/download:484760%20"&gt;Trigger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/download:484761"&gt;Plug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of sharing is called &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware%20"&gt;**open-source hardware
design**&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and
the practice allows people to build on each other's ideas.&amp;nbsp; You can also
use &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tinkercad.com/things/6PYe7ez5NDC%20"&gt;Tinkercad&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to copy
this design&amp;nbsp;and modify it with your own ideas.&amp;nbsp; Progress is faster this
way, so open-source design is&amp;nbsp;the best way to get the most out of 3D
printing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Doodler 3" class="aligncenter wp-image-1637" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2014/03/Doodler-3.jpg" style="width: 518px; height: 409px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;Phaser Handle&lt;/strong&gt; makes the 3Doodler look cool (like the Star Trek
weapon), but it also makes doodling more comfortable (especially for
people with small hands).&amp;nbsp; The makers of the 3Doodler obviously have
plans for making a handle, because they provided a handy mounting
bracket with threaded holes for M3 screws.&amp;nbsp; But we couldn’t wait!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The handle alone is beneficial, but using the trigger with the handle
keeps the hand more relaxed during extended doodling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2014/03/Doodler-4.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Doodler 4" class="aligncenter wp-image-1638" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2014/03/Doodler-4.jpg" style="width: 518px; height: 419px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Phaser Handle is attached to the 3Doodler with a pair of M3 x 10mm
screws (any head design).&amp;nbsp; The trigger attaches to the handle with a
pair of small flat head screws (such as 6-32 x 3/8 inch or M3 x 6mm)
serving as hinge pins.&amp;nbsp; The screws are available at Lowes and Home
Depot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2014/03/Doodler-5.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Doodler 5" class="aligncenter wp-image-1639" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2014/03/Doodler-5.jpg" style="width: 518px; height: 383px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The handle is hollow to allow access to a mounting screw (rather than
having an infill of plastic in a sparse honeycomb pattern).&amp;nbsp; If your
printer drops a few threads while bridging across the top of the handle,
just let it finish the job.&amp;nbsp; Chances are it will recover before the top
layer is reached.&amp;nbsp; If it fails, you may have to adjust your slicer
settings (such as slowing the speed for bridges) and try again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our next blog post, we will show you how to use the 3Doodler itself
to update the Phaser Handle. &amp;nbsp; The exercise will be a good demonstration
of using the 3Doodler to hack an existing product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

got two ROMs instead of the authentic board's 6 (9 for Ms Pac), and is
substantially smaller than the &amp;quot;real thing&amp;quot;. &amp;nbsp;The only issue is that the
audio is poor... REALLY poor. &amp;nbsp;It makes sounds but they're... wrong and
noisy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took over some desk space at Interlock and got to work. &amp;nbsp;(I should
note that the beverages you can see here are other people's, not mine.
;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I traced the audio circuit on a real Pac-Man schematic (seen on my
laptop's monitor), and buzzed it out on the Yenox board to try to
corrolate the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9SZwuigjePY/UuqihQhaOqI/AAAAAAAACqc/lyX0wtzBBfg/s1600/2014-01-30+14.05.06.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F3.bp.blogspot.com%2F-9SZwuigjePY%2FUuqihQhaOqI%2FAAAAAAAACqc%2FlyX0wtzBBfg%2Fs1600%2F2014-01-30%2B14.05.06.jpg&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="width: 480px; height: 640px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to trace four similar paths from a quad flip-flop, through a quad
bidirecional switch, to the audio output. &amp;nbsp;It got really confusing at
times, and took me probably a bit longer than it should have. &amp;nbsp;For the
most part, they were pin-for-pin correct as far as how they were wired.
&amp;nbsp;These chips have the same device (eg, a flip flop, or a logic gate)
repeated 4 or 6 times. &amp;nbsp;In some cases here, the Yenox board had a
different one of these devices hooked up, which added to the confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This portion of the circuit uses 8 resistors to make a digital-to-analog
converter. These generally work by having different resistance levels,
usually something like multiples of eachother, eg, &amp;nbsp;10k ohm, 22k ohm,
47k ohm then 100kohm. &amp;nbsp;I traced out all of the lines on the Yenox board
and I found out that not only were the resistors in the wrong order on
the board, but they were also wildly wrong (47 ohm instead of 4.7k ohm),
which you can see in this table I made:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Nnjo_5_2VUc/Uuqe6k2NJxI/AAAAAAAACp4/Ff-1Iqri6Bo/s1600/2014-01-28+23.07.43.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F3.bp.blogspot.com%2F-Nnjo_5_2VUc%2FUuqe6k2NJxI%2FAAAAAAAACp4%2FFf-1Iqri6Bo%2Fs1600%2F2014-01-28%2B23.07.43.jpg&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="width: 480px; height: 640px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zeQMG0ohkqA/Uuqe8kFdqkI/AAAAAAAACqQ/SZjMuEWZ7aI/s1600/2014-01-28+23.07.59.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F2.bp.blogspot.com%2F-zeQMG0ohkqA%2FUuqe8kFdqkI%2FAAAAAAAACqQ%2FSZjMuEWZ7aI%2Fs1600%2F2014-01-28%2B23.07.59.jpg&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see these resistors here on the Yenox board, right next to the
JAMMA connector. &amp;nbsp;They start from the left with R1 (my notation.) &amp;nbsp;The
printing on the board completely matched the resistance values that sat
on them, so it's obvious that the engineer who made this board seriously
screwed it up in the design stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MRXGr6YFnAI/Uuqe7IEuznI/AAAAAAAACqA/CEcTI-WDWrg/s1600/2014-01-29+00.00.35.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image4" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F4.bp.blogspot.com%2F-MRXGr6YFnAI%2FUuqe7IEuznI%2FAAAAAAAACqA%2FCEcTI-WDWrg%2Fs1600%2F2014-01-29%2B00.00.35.jpg&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I replaced resistors R3 - R7. &amp;nbsp;I put them in with the gold band closer
to the JAMMA connector, rather than the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now it sounds near-perfect. &amp;nbsp;There's a little bit of popping left,
but I was getting tired and decided to head home for the night. &amp;nbsp;I'll
hook it up to an oscilloscope at some point and see if i can figure out
which line is causing problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For what it's worth, I also did the same as this on the video path DAC,
seen in the above picture as the next three groups of resistors. &amp;nbsp;In the
above, the group of four and then the group of five are for audio, then
the next group of three is for the &amp;quot;red&amp;quot;, next three for &amp;quot;green&amp;quot;, next
two for &amp;quot;blue&amp;quot;, and the remaining two are for the sync. &amp;nbsp;Again, there
were some 47 ohm resistors mixed in, and notice two of the three in the
&amp;quot;green&amp;quot; section are identical (red-red-brown)... which is surely wrong.
&amp;nbsp;Color is now perfect on the board too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many years back, I hooked up a spare JAMMA harness to an old PC power
supply, a monitor and some repurposed joystick pads. &amp;nbsp;(JAMMA is a
standard connector size and pinout to hook up arcade game boards into
arcade cabinets. &amp;nbsp;Most of my arcade game boards are either natively
Jamma (Mortal Kombat, Klax, Block-out) or I have adapters to hook them
up using JAMMA. &amp;nbsp;(Dig-Dug, Pac-Man, etc)). &amp;nbsp;One board that I've been
using with it recently is a knockoff Ms. Pac-Man board, seen in these
photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being that I've been wanting to work on arcadey projects recently at
Interlock, I decided to make this thing a lot less janky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dXu8idF4Gos/UuqcgxrHTTI/AAAAAAAACpw/kglKFQAxKSQ/s1600/2014-01-28+21.15.52.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F1.bp.blogspot.com%2F-dXu8idF4Gos%2FUuqcgxrHTTI%2FAAAAAAAACpw%2FkglKFQAxKSQ%2Fs1600%2F2014-01-28%2B21.15.52.jpg&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The harness/rig I have was always kind of a hack. &amp;nbsp;The video and audio
wires terminated in a small box with some knobs which were meant to
attenuate the signal but never really worked right. &amp;nbsp;The power switch
was on this cord that came out and was weirdly fastened to the side of
the power supply. &amp;nbsp;I decided to clean this up while
at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/"&gt;Interlock&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for open night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZsVc0fKDW7I/Uuqcg9U7owI/AAAAAAAACpk/HtINUUqLkOk/s1600/2014-01-28+21.14.07.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F3.bp.blogspot.com%2F-ZsVc0fKDW7I%2FUuqcg9U7owI%2FAAAAAAAACpk%2FHtINUUqLkOk%2Fs1600%2F2014-01-28%2B21.14.07.jpg&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that I happened to have the right 6 pin DIN
connector for this old RGB monitor (basically a Commodore Amiga 1084
clone). &amp;nbsp; So I wired up Red, Green, Blue, and Ground directly to the
correct pins on it. &amp;nbsp;JAMMA spits out composite video, but this monitor
takes in Horizontal and Vertical sync. &amp;nbsp;I knew that some monitors would
take in composite sync on their Vertical Sync line, so I tried that...
and it worked! Huzzah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only video issue now is that the game boards put out video that's
slightly too hot/too high a voltage, so I should put attenuation
resistors inside the din connector or something...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the JAMMA interface spits out amplified audio, I decided to
hook up an RCA plug on the audio lines anyway, to plug it into the
line-level in on the monitor. &amp;nbsp;As long as I'm careful it will be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ACC-6mHPO68/Uuqcg43SeQI/AAAAAAAACps/Ik2i8_69l8U/s1600/2014-01-28+21.13.46.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F4.bp.blogspot.com%2F-ACC-6mHPO68%2FUuqcg43SeQI%2FAAAAAAAACps%2FIk2i8_69l8U%2Fs1600%2F2014-01-28%2B21.13.46.jpg&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here it is being driven by my Yenox Ms Pac-Man board with the
&amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://umlautllama.com/projects/gamehacks/#horiz"&gt;Horizontal Ms
Pac&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; rom hack.
&amp;nbsp;You can see the power switch sticking out of the side of the power
supply there. &amp;nbsp;It's not the most optimal thing ever, but it's
substantially cleaner than before. &amp;nbsp;Perhaps I'll replace that switch
with a nice carling switch in the future. &amp;nbsp;I'll need this test rig for
the next task, which is fixing the audio on this board. &amp;nbsp;It sounds
horrid...&lt;/p&gt;

annual meeting. Normally this is a time for everyone to hang out, eat,
drink, and give presentations. Previous years, I give my personal
presentation about things I wanted to do, things I failed at, things I
succeeded, and things I'll be attempting the coming year. We invited
everyone this year to give a similar style presentation and the results
were pretty interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="our-past"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Past&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick review of where we're at. The organization started in
September-ish of 2009, where we met in coffee shops around Rochester, to
try and come up with whether or not we should make a hackerspace in the
area. We came to the conclusion that we wanted to do everything from the
ground up, receiving no outside financial help. At the time, we were
pretty adamant about not having it called a &amp;quot;Makerspace&amp;quot; because the
membership had a much wider range of interests than just making
(software development, hardware reverse engineering, network security,
radio, art, etc). So our bylaws stated that we will create a space
focused on the interests of the members at that time. This gave us a lot
of flexibility to interpret what the space would be used for. We
received our &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://appext20.dos.ny.gov/corp_public/CORPSEARCH.ENTITY_INFORMATION?p_nameid=3901177&amp;amp;p_corpid=3894341&amp;amp;p_entity_name=Interlock%20Rochester&amp;amp;p_name_type=A&amp;amp;p_search_type=BEGINS&amp;amp;p_srch_results_page=0"&gt;New York State articles of
Incorporation&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;just
about January 1st of 2010. From there we have expanded spaces starting
out at a meager 200 sq ft temporary space, moving to a 500 sq ft space,
and eventually to our current home which is over 1200 sq ft. Our
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.interlockroc.org/wiki/index.php/Mission_Statement"&gt;mission
statement&lt;/a&gt;
has been the same since its inception, to provide a space to its members
and the community, as well as be an organization that helps individuals
developer their skills in science, art, and technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="our-present"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Present&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, we had a wide range of accomplishments from our members. Here
are a list of things have been working on recently:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reverse engineering Ms. Pac-Man&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using thermite and tannerite in fun ways&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take EdX, Coursera, classes together: Cryptography, in-line power
supplies, calculus, basic electronics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a high power antennae with low amounts of money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security research using open source intelligence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a Raspberry Pi and home sensors to graph and monitor
temperature changes in your fridge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Artistically building a gigantic light bulb array (without burning
down your apartment)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Converting your Perl scripts over to BASH (as an excuse to hang out
with your kid)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skip's Adventures in 3D printing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might give you an idea of the completely different background that
our members have, but with the common denominator of expanding and
learning more than they do right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My secrets:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I only use homemade brown sugar

&lt;li&gt;I sometimes will use AP flour but find I need to use a little more
than the recipe calls for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use milk chocolate chips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I only use real butter and always fresh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the cookie scoop! Uniformity is godliness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1)&amp;nbsp;Humidity, how loose or compact is your flour, what type of butter
are you using, how many chocolate chips do you want to use, the size of
your cookie scoop, how hot does your oven get, how much patience do you
have, who will be eating the cookies (let’s face it you want to impress
but not everyone deserves the best).&lt;/p&gt;

it's okay. &amp;nbsp;I have a couple of jewelry boxes already, but some things
are difficult to store. &amp;nbsp;Like most women with a thing for jewelry, I
have more earrings than I know what to do with. &amp;nbsp;It had gotten to the
point where I no longer had room in my jewelry box for any new pieces,
and it was becoming more than a little difficult to sort through what I
had, despite having organized them into different spaces in the built in
storage tray in the jewelry box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, it was time for a change,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to make myself a earring storage and display device that I
could set out on the top of my dresser, that would allow me enough room
to hold all of my current collection, as well as expand it and not have
to develop a new storage system anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer came in the form of upcycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went on Craigslist and looked for used windows for sale. &amp;nbsp;I found a
guy who lived not too far from me who had a whole stash of used windows
that he had removed from his home as part of a remodeling project. &amp;nbsp;I
went to see him, had an awesome conversation with him, and bought
several windows from him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose one of the long, slim windows to use for this project. &amp;nbsp;This
particular window measures approximately 40&amp;quot; x 18&amp;quot;. &amp;nbsp;I removed the storm
pane from it, brushed off the loose paint with a stiff bristle paint
brush, and lightly cleaned the glass (I say lightly because I wanted to
keep the rustic look it had. &amp;nbsp;I didn't want it to look overly done up or
commercialized.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step was a quick trip to Home Depot to buy a roll of window
screening and some upholstery nails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my supply run, I came back to Interlock and got started in
earnest. &amp;nbsp;I will fully admit that I did not follow any safety protocols
for this project. &amp;nbsp;I wasn't wearing safety glasses, steel toed shoes,
gloves, a hard hat, or ear protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I cut the screen to size with a dull pair of tin snips I had
laying around, and propped the window on a padded desk chair to nail the
screening on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used a basic claw hammer to attach the screening to the wooden window
frame. &amp;nbsp;I was actually a bit surprised at how easy it was. &amp;nbsp;I tacked one
of the long sides on first, then stretched the screening tight across
the frame and tacked on the opposite long side. &amp;nbsp;I stood the window up
on the floor to attach the short side and then trimmed off the excess
with my snips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took the newly screened window home and placed it on top of my
dresser, anchoring it in place to protect from feline related
accidents/crashes by placing one of my jewelry boxes in front on if and
looping a pair of swimming flippers I have hanging from the attached
mirror on my dresser over the top corner. &amp;nbsp;Improvised solutions people,
they work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once it was in place, I hung each pair of hook backed earrings I own
onto the screening, setting their backs aside into a small bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some pictures of the finished product in place, and covered in
earrings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2013/12/100_2989.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="100_2989" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1604" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2013/12/100_2989-300x225.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 225px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here are some close-ups of the tacks attaching the screen to the
window frame:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2013/12/100_2992.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="100_2992" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1607" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2013/12/100_2992-225x300.jpg" style="width: 225px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2013/12/100_2991.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="100_2991" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1606" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2013/12/100_2991-300x225.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 225px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2013/12/100_2990.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="100_2990" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1605" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2013/12/100_2990-225x300.jpg" style="width: 225px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All said, it took about 20 minutes to make, and 20 minutes to fill up
with my collection. &amp;nbsp;I have plenty of room to expand into as my
collection grows, I can move the whole thing pretty easily, and if I
wanted to turn the whole thing 90○ and set it on the floor, propped
against the wall, I wouldn't even have to take the earring off and put
them back on, they will just rotate with the window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the total cost of this project was just under $10, so I think it
was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do this same thing with a window with no glass, but I like that
the panes are still in it, it adds a certain je ne sais quoi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you decide to replicate this process, please be careful. &amp;nbsp;If you
don't know what you're doing, or aren't sure if you know what you're
doing, ask for help from someone in the know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Craigslist Hunting!&lt;/p&gt;

relatively simple to pull off. &amp;nbsp;It's called tape painting. &amp;nbsp;The idea is
that you apply pieces of tape to a blank canvas, in any manner you want,
then paint the canvas, again, in any manner you want. &amp;nbsp;After you're done
painting, you remove the paint to reveal spaces of black canvas
interspersed with your painting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the blank canvas I started with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2013/12/100_2677.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="blank canvas" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1595" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2013/12/100_2677-300x225.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 225px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked it up, like all my canvas's at Ollie's here in Rochester.
&amp;nbsp;Hopefully, it goes without saying that you remove the plastic and label
that it comes wrapped in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to apply the tape. &amp;nbsp;You can do this with just about any
masking-type tape. &amp;nbsp;I chose painters tape because that's what I had on
hand. &amp;nbsp;You can apply the tape in any pattern you like. &amp;nbsp;I chose a
geometric patter, making sure to wrap the tape all the way around the
edges and on to the back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2013/12/100_2675.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="100_2675" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1593" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2013/12/100_2675-300x225.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 225px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the tape is applied, the painting can commence. &amp;nbsp;This, of course,
is the funnest step. &amp;nbsp;I typically only work with acrylic paint because
it's cheap, easy to work with, easy to obtain, easy to clean, and can be
applied with a variety of techniques. &amp;nbsp;I decided to go with an abstract
theme because this was my first attempt with this kind of art, and when
it comes to abstract, there is no wrong way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, I chose some colors, threw them on a palette, and then
applied them to the canvas at random. &amp;nbsp;You paint right over the tape as
if it weren't even there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I neglected to take a picture of this step, but I'm sure
you can use you're imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After painting the canvas, making sure to extend the paint onto the
sides of the canvas, remove the tape while the paint is still wet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure when you remove the tape, since most of it will be stuck
together, that you don't allow the wet paint on the tape to touch the
wet paint of the canvas or you will end up with smearing that you did
not anticipate in planning the chaos of your abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the finished product:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2013/12/100_2678.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="100_2678" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1597" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2013/12/100_2678-300x225.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 225px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have the ability to plan ahead, you should attach the picture
hangers before painting, but if you chronically forget that step as I
do, wait until the painting dries, then lay it on a towel or other
padded surface to avoid scratches, and attach the hardware to the back.
&amp;nbsp;I typically use hardware that can be found in any picture hanging kit
from the dollar store or other reasonably cheap retail store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is true with almost anything, you can customize this project in any
way you want. &amp;nbsp;More tape, less tape, defined pattern, no pattern,
abstract painting, realistic painting, whatever you want. &amp;nbsp;The point is
to have fun and create a unique piece of art for very little cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Painting!&lt;/p&gt;

be selling stuff in the space now and letting our members come in and
sell their interesting stuff. For example, we have a bunch of servers,
workstations, ham radio equipment, odd electronics, monitors, etc etc.
We really don't know how much stuff we'll have to get rid of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of the event is to raise money for Interlock so things being
sold by the hackerspace go back into keeping the space going, and
expanding its facilities. We are accepting donations for items that you
find around the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of this event is that starting at 7:00pm, we'll be doing
lightning talks. You can come for the sales, but stay for the
presentations. Lightning talks are 5-10 minute presentations from people
all over the community about nerdy subjects that interest them. If you
have something you'd like to share, come in and show us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll also be giving you food that our members have made you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, I decided to work on this idea I've had for more than a year
and a half. &lt;strong&gt;The Brain - a silicone based brain with controllable
LEDs inside.&lt;/strong&gt; I have some ideas of what to do next with it, but this
first iteration is just to be a fun decoration for Halloween.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/11/2013-10-27-11.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="2013-10-27-1[1]" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1551" src="/wp-uploads/2013/11/2013-10-27-11-225x300.jpg" style="width: 225px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/11/2013-10-271.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="2013-10-27[1]" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1555" src="/wp-uploads/2013/11/2013-10-271-225x300.jpg" style="width: 225px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="why-the-brain"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why The Brain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when Interlock was moving into their current space, there was this
cool area in the center of it, that was surrounded by windows. That
turned into the network room and I really wanted to use that window for
something. Show something cool in the window or whatever. I came up with
this idea that I would have a brain to represent network activity. When
a host goes down, the brain reflects that. If there was no Internet
connectivity, the brain would show that too. The first version of the
brain is not to that level yet, but it's in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="brain-1-0"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Brain 1.0&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain 1.0 is a Platsil GEL-10, silicone brain with a hollowed center. In
the center is a plastic project box housing an Arduino with Neo Pixels
attached to it. A Neo Pixel is an Adafruit project that is meant to be a
low cost, multi-color LED that you can daisy-chain, or string together
in-line. There's really no reason to use Neo Pixels for this project
besides the fact that I had some already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Halloween Brain Jello mold from Amazon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Platsil GEL-10 from&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.shop.brickintheyard.com/PlatSil-Gel-10-Pint-Kit-2-Lbs-Gel10U2.htm"&gt;BITY Mold
Supply&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tupperware container donated to the cause&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XL Breaking Bad meth making gloves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mixing containers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="making-the-brain"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making the Brain:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the most interesting part to me. I picked up the type of
PlatSil that is a 1 to 1 compound either by volume or by mass so I
didn't need to worry about mixing too much. I took 500ML of A and mixed
it with 500ML of B. This stuff has a 6 minute lifetime from the time you
start mixing to the time it starts to harden. There are ways to slow
this down, but again, I didn't need to do that. I spent 2 minutes mixing
because some guy on YouTube said this is important, and my recent
adventures in Thermite taught me the lesson that they're serious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I poured it in, I used a can of &amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.shop.brickintheyard.com/Pol-Ease-2300-12-Oz-Spray-Can-2300.htm"&gt;Pol-Ease
2300&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;release
which is used to keep the brain separated from the Jello mold. I was
reminded the hard way what happens when you forget this. Pouring it into
the mold was pretty simple but I made a small clay holder for it so I
could make sure it stayed level. After the contents were dumped in, I
sunk the plastic project container that was going to be my hollowed
inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole things hardens within 30 minutes but because mine was in the
garage in October, it was more like an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this stuff isn't very cheap, I did a demo mold just to make sure
I was on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/11/IMG_20131024_16070411.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG_20131024_1607041[1]" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1554" src="/wp-uploads/2013/11/IMG_20131024_16070411-300x225.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 225px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="platsil-gel-10"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PlatSil Gel-10:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal was to create a mold of a brain that was rubbery and brain like.
This Platsil line of chemicals are designed to create molds for other
things. There wasn't a lot of people making actual things from the
material itself but I really like the texture and toughness of using it
as the model. I will say that it is 100% overkill for what I wanted.
There's probably someone that can recommend a
better,&amp;nbsp;cheaper&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;alternative but for me this worked in the time
frame I needed it to. They have a bunch of different types and I really
wanted light to diffuse through it so I got that translucent version. It
still comes out pretty white depending on how thick of a mold you're
making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/11/IMG_20131025_17073011.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG_20131025_1707301[1]" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1556" src="/wp-uploads/2013/11/IMG_20131025_17073011-225x300.jpg" style="width: 225px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="neo-pixel"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Neo Pixel:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neo Pixels are really slick. They have 4 leads on them. Power, Ground,
signal in, and a signal out. The biggest benefit is that each pixel is
individually addressable without the need for multiple connections.
Pixel 0 connects to pixel 1 that connects to pixel N through a single
&amp;nbsp;wire connected to your microcontroller or whatever you're using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power takes +5v, and there is a warning about memory consumption
especially with smaller Arduinos and extremely long chains of Neo Pixels
(up to 500 at 30 FPS). My 4 didn't mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adafruit has a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel"&gt;Neo Pixel
library&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that you can
use pretty easily, even if you just want to hack one of their demos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/11/1060quattro_MED11.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="1060quattro_MED1[1]" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1557" src="/wp-uploads/2013/11/1060quattro_MED11-300x231.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 231px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="arduino"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Arduino:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my hacked code to make the brain throb between red and pink.
Again, a Neo Pixel is overkill for doing this but it's fun none-the-less
and I'll be upgrading it next iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

consuming process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/10/1550_LRG-600x4611.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="http://www.adafruit.com/blog/2013/10/04/new-product-grand-ideas-studio-jtagulator/" class="aligncenter" src="/wp-uploads/2013/10/1550_LRG-600x4611.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 461px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="section" id="jtag"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JTAG&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) is just a name for a standard way of
providing a debug interface to your hardware devices. What's nice about
it is with one interface, you can provide debugging capabilities to a
variety of chips on your board. So if you have two microcontrollers,
each of them can be separately accessed through one interface. Pretty
cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hackers have been using JTAG for years to reverse hardware. You might
have seen them used when messing with router firmware to install DD-WRT
or OpenWRT. For WRT supported routers, JTAG often gives you the ability
to push a custom firmware onto a board or extra the firmware that is
currently installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="jtag-for-security"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JTAG For Security&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course with all of my projects, I add a security twist. JTAG lets me
gain low level access to a device and see how it works. An interface may
be able to dump an EEPROM which could contain the cryptographic keys
that are securing another piece of memory on the chip. Or it could give
me a serial console similar to a root terminal that lets me interact
with a device like a computer. The point is, it's a debuggable interface
that I can use to exploit in a variety of ways to learn about how the
device works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might wonder why these interfaces even exist on hardware since they
give hackers the opportunity to access your hardware. Because JTAG is so
useful for debugging, manufacturers actually use this interface the same
way you would, to make sure the device is functioning properly. That's
why it's highly likely you'll find some kind of debug interface for your
boards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="jtagulator-setup"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JTAGulator Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JTAGulator connects to your computer using a micro-USB cable that
shows up as a serial device. In Linux, that device will be something
like /dev/ttyUSB0. It uses 115.2K baud 8N1. Once connected using
something like minicom or gtkterm in Linux, you'll see a prompt of
available options. You can now start JTAGulating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To connect the JTAGulator to a device, the board is designed to use the
cables from a standard Bus Pirate board. You can either do that, or just
use some aligator clips to connect to the pins. Either way, the board
you're working on is going to need to be have the JTAG leads broken out
so you can connect something to them. In my little Asus router that I
found, these pins are pretty easy to access. I just soldered some cables
on to them, and added a bit of glue to make sure they kept. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_1527&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;225&amp;quot;]&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/10/IMG_20131015_1929571.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Asus Router with wires near JTAG leads" class="size-medium wp-image-1527" src="/wp-uploads/2013/10/IMG_20131015_1929571-225x300.jpg" style="width: 225px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Asus Router with wires near JTAG
leads[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this point, your router should be connected to the JTAGulator, your
JTAGulator connected to your computer, and you should have a console
interface waiting for directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step is to set the voltage. It has a range of 1.2 to 3.3V and
this is going to be important for you to figure out before hand. (If you
don't know how to figure out the voltage on your board, you can probably
ask someone at Interlock to show you using a multimeter.) Then you can
choose how you'd like to scan for JTAG. There are two options, one is
more thorough and time consuming but I don't have enough data to tell
you which is better for which situation (feel free to chime in if you
know). Either one will prompt you for which pins you'd like to test
with, which should correspond to the pins you've connected on your
JTAGulator. When you run it, it will attempt every possible combination
of pins until it thinks it has found the right one. It also has a UART
discovery mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the first JTAG discovery product out there but it's the
first I've used. I mentioned that the project is open source so here is
a link to Joe's site to help you build your own board if you want, or if
you're like me, you can buy them from a company like
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.adafruit.com/blog/2013/10/04/new-product-grand-ideas-studio-jtagulator/"&gt;Adafruit&lt;/a&gt;,

52 in the Rochester City School District.&amp;nbsp; The 4 weeks of &lt;em&gt;Tech Camp&lt;/em&gt;
ran 3 mornings per week.&amp;nbsp; Michael Slade (another volunteer) and Susan
Reuter (the teacher) rounded out the instructional team, and 20 students
developed their skills at rapid prototyping while having fun learning
some principles of physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/08/Americas-Cup-Toy-Boat1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="America's Cup Toy Boat" class="aligncenter wp-image-1489" src="/wp-uploads/2013/08/Americas-Cup-Toy-Boat1.png" style="width: 480px; height: 341px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The students each constructed an America's Cup Toy Boat Kit&lt;/strong&gt; (an STL
file for the design can be downloaded at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:116005"&gt;America's Cup Toy Boat Kit by
MacGyvrBot - Thingiverse&lt;/a&gt;)
with soda straws and parts made on a Printrbot LC (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://printrbot.com/shop/printrbot-lc/"&gt;Printrbot LC (v2) |
printrbot&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;nbsp; Then they
conducted a &amp;quot;shoebox regatta&amp;quot; where the sailboats were each sailed in a
plastic shoebox half full of water.&amp;nbsp; The boats successfully (1) sailed
on a reach (with wind from the side) (2) from one end of the box to the
other, (3) without touching the side of the box, and (4) under the power
of a student gently blowing through a straw from the side of the box.
&amp;nbsp; This activity taught the students the basic principles of sailing
while they developed confidence in their new skills of measuring
materials (the straws) and assembling rapid prototypes (the boats) as
MacGyvrBot chugged out the plastic parts right before their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subsequently the students learned some basic skills in CAD&lt;/strong&gt; using
Tinkercad (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tinkercad.com/"&gt;Tinkercad - Mind to design in
minutes&lt;/a&gt;) and Sketchup (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sketchup.com/"&gt;SketchUp | 3D for
Everyone&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the end of the camp, students evaluated their experience by
**(anonymously)&amp;nbsp;**rating some of the lessons presented.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/08/Student-ratings.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Student ratings" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1490" src="/wp-uploads/2013/08/Student-ratings.png" style="width: 590px; height: 308px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Students' ratings clearly show that using the 3D Printer and CAD are
at the top of the list of things they would like to do again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/08/MacGyverBot-in-the-classroom.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="MacGyverBot in the classroom" class="aligncenter wp-image-1491" src="/wp-uploads/2013/08/MacGyverBot-in-the-classroom.jpg" style="width: 553px; height: 338px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A warning about Tinkercad:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were special work-around requirements that we encountered for
safely using the current version of Tinkercad with young students, and
they will be further discussed in a later posting.&amp;nbsp; Tinkercad is
resident on the internet cloud and not on the local computer, so
continuous adult supervision is required (with an adult logged into the
website) for Tinkercad to be safely used by kids (else the child's
access to sharing on the internet will be unsupervised).&amp;nbsp; Autodesk, the
new owner of Tinkercad, is working on eliminating this requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parents and teachers, stay tuned…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More about what we learned from participating in the Tech Camp will be
discussed in later postings.&amp;nbsp; One of the neat things about
rapid-prototyping in the classroom is the ease with which teachers,
parents and designers can share their designs and ideas with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We shared that portion of the first floor with some folks from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.team340.org/"&gt;Greater
Rochester Robotics&lt;/a&gt;, who brought the robot
from their most recent FIRST Robotics Competition season, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc/2013-game"&gt;Ultimate

through, such a collision &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; have had a role to play in loosening

(acrylonitrile/butadiene/styrene) on the MacGyverbot. This led us to
discover that kids love them some bright plastic sharks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An early test result, showing text and millseconds since power-on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a year ago, I bought a few 11 digit, 7 segment red LED displays

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An early test result, showing text and millseconds since power-on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a year ago, I bought a few 11 digit, 7 segment red LED displays
from Active Surplus up on Queen Street in Toronto. (Excellent store. &amp;nbsp;If
you're into hacking stuff at all, it's well worth the trip. Look for the
monkey on Queen street to find their entrance.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past week, I wasn't sure what to do at Interlock on Tuesday night,
but I had recently re-found these displays, so I figured I would finally
get them working. &amp;nbsp;I hit Radio Shack to get a Seeed Studio Arduino
Shield ($10 with a mess of components, probably the best deal in all of
Radio Shack.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gRsOSI_LtfU/UZZz1mwZnpI/AAAAAAAACb4/or8abBr4-TM/s1600/IMG_1459.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gRsOSI_LtfU/UZZz1mwZnpI/AAAAAAAACb4/or8abBr4-TM/s640/IMG_1459.JPG" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The display with a header soldered on, and the shield with its assorted
parts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was all set to figure out how to reverse-engineer the pinout on the
bottom of the display; I googled for the LED module, and found specs on
those, and then on a whim, decided to check on the entire module board,
a Rohm LU-3011, and found the jackpot,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bobdasquirrel.blogspot.com/2011/08/rohm-lu-3011-led-display-module.html"&gt;this post about figuring out
the
pinout&lt;/a&gt;.
&amp;nbsp;It suddenly became very easy to do this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two key things gleaned from that above post, which I have mirrored
here, are this table of enables for each of the 11 digits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col width="13%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="7%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="7%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="7%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="7%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="7%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="7%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="9%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="9%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="9%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="9%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="9%" /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Digit&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Pin&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and this image, showing the pin mappings of the segments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-O2_Yz-oWDgE/UZZstuDtijI/AAAAAAAACbQ/eLleHoWirVw/s1600/digit.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-O2_Yz-oWDgE/UZZstuDtijI/AAAAAAAACbQ/eLleHoWirVw/s320/digit.JPG" style="width: 320px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mapping of the segments to the pins on the header.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic way these displays work is that all of the 7 segments (plus
one decimal point) are all tied together to the pins specified above.
&amp;nbsp;Then the anodes for each of the displays are broken out to the pins in
the table above. &amp;nbsp;So to draw a '7', you would set all of the segments to
LOW, except for pins 11, 19, and 7 which you set HIGH. &amp;nbsp;Then to turn on
a specific digit, let's say digit 11 (rightmost), you set the digit
enable pin 18 to be an output, and set it LOW. &amp;nbsp;Set all of the other
digit enables to be inputs (tri-state, not low or high), and only
position 11 will show a &amp;quot;7&amp;quot;. &amp;nbsp;You repeat this for all of the 11 digits
in the display, and you can display 11 full digits from just those 19
pins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my code (available below) I start at digit 1, and work down to digit
11, enabling each one, in turn, showing its segments, waiting 1
millisecond, then disable that digit, move on to the next one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I soldered a pin header on the display, and built up a shield to plug it
into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bh1tSeeWrGA/UZZ0MK4HVlI/AAAAAAAACcA/cBy-KgCnyfg/s1600/IMG_1463.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bh1tSeeWrGA/UZZ0MK4HVlI/AAAAAAAACcA/cBy-KgCnyfg/s640/IMG_1463.JPG" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of the digit enables wired up. &amp;nbsp;The top ones are a bit messy. Sorry
about that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wired it up such that the digit enables and segments are wired
directly to IO lines on my Arduino. &amp;nbsp;This used all of the IO lines,
minus the D13 pin, which has an on-board LED.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code that I wrote (available below) lets you do arbitrary digits per
character, so that i can do (primitive) alphanumerics, or do animation
patterns, etc. &amp;nbsp;I also store the decimal point as a separate character
going in to the display code, so &amp;quot;3.141&amp;quot; is five ascii characters going
in, but a flag is set on the '3' position saying that this digit should
also display its decimal point, so it only consumes four digits in the
display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Iu8GH9eT68o/UZZ0WDS63kI/AAAAAAAACcI/HTfpMMcb3Fg/s1600/IMG_1464.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image4" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Iu8GH9eT68o/UZZ0WDS63kI/AAAAAAAACcI/HTfpMMcb3Fg/s640/IMG_1464.JPG" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;just testing out all of the segments and digits&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, it displays a nice clock and some animations on my desk, but I
plan on changing it around a little in the near future. &amp;nbsp;I want to use
the D13 line as one of the segment enables (probably decimal point) and
move the segment enables off of the Serial Receive line. &amp;nbsp;That way i
will be able to control it via serial to display patterns, animations or
text content. &amp;nbsp;Since the hardware serial port is hardwired to 0 and 1,
and I will be using the TX line for the LED displays, I'll have to
instead use the Software Serial, with only its Receive line mapped to an
IO pin, and its Transmit line mapped to junk. I've done this before and
it works well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code for this project is&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/BleuLlama/GeodesicSphere/tree/master/Projects/SevenSegment11"&gt;available in my Geodesic Sphere github

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hello.&amp;nbsp; My name is Skip.&amp;nbsp; I’m an inventaholic.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; I am compelled to
invent things for reasons that I can not control.&amp;nbsp; I would like to
welcome you to Inventaholics Anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past 40 years, I have followed a path familiar to many people
with my affliction by accumulating as many patents as I could. &amp;nbsp;But with
the help of my new friends at INTERLOCK, I have overcome those
tendencies, and I am proud to say that I have moved on to the sober
world of hackers and makers.&amp;nbsp; A world&amp;nbsp; known as the*&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_hardware"&gt;Open-Source
Hardware
Movement&lt;/a&gt;.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_1418&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignright&amp;quot;
width=&amp;quot;281&amp;quot;]&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/04/stepcounter-1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="stepcounter 1" class="wp-image-1418" src="/wp-uploads/2013/04/stepcounter-1.png" style="width: 281px; height: 274px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; First Patent: The Stepcounter[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In many ways, being an inventor has scarred my life.&lt;/strong&gt;
In the early 1970s I squandered all the funds I could beg or borrow (at least I
didn’t steal), and I blew it all on my first patent.&amp;nbsp; The Stepcounter
was a research device to measure the activity levels of laboratory
animals.&amp;nbsp; My wife wanted to make the down payment on a house.&amp;nbsp; Thanks to
my addiction, we rented for 25 years before we bought our first house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Brown, the author of a book called Inventors at Work asked my
old friend, the late Bob&amp;nbsp;Gundlach an important question during an
interview:&amp;nbsp;“Is it better to be an inventor working for a large
corporation, or would you rather be working on your own?”&amp;nbsp; I can relate
to Bob’s answer: “&lt;strong&gt;Being an inventor on your own is a good way to go
broke!&lt;/strong&gt; Being an inventor in a corporation is a very fortunate
happenstance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even within a corporation you run into the Not Invented Here
Syndrome.&amp;nbsp; If you offer a solution to improve a product that is outside
of your assigned responsibilities, you will probably&amp;nbsp;be rebuked with
something like “No thanks. I’ve got my own ideas and I know what I’m
doing.&amp;nbsp; Go work on your own assignment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_1419&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignright&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;288&amp;quot;]&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/04/vue-iPad-in-comfort.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="vue iPad in comfort" class="wp-image-1419" src="/wp-uploads/2013/04/vue-iPad-in-comfort.jpg" style="width: 288px; height: 170px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; vue-stand[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I graduated from Xerox a few years ago and &lt;strong&gt;in 2010, my friend Ken and
I invented a stand for iPads that we called the vue-stand.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; It would
hold your iPad at a comfortable eye-level.&amp;nbsp; As a human factors engineer
I have spent decades designing easy-to-use products, and I thought that
we were onto something.&amp;nbsp; After we spent thousands of dollars to do a
pilot run at manufacturing and did a little test market, I couldn’t help
remembering Bob’s words of wisdom.&amp;nbsp; People didn’t buy the vue for
reasons we now understand.&amp;nbsp; We decided not to keep throwing money at
trying to market a dead horse, so I bought out Ken’s interest in our
company, and I continue selling off my inventory&amp;nbsp;online without
promotion.&amp;nbsp; That inventory will cut my losses, but it will not cover my
investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last summer something happened that changed my life:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; A couple of
guys from this
&lt;em&gt;`Hackerspace &amp;lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace&amp;gt;`__&lt;/em&gt; called
INTERLOCK Rochester gave a talk at
&lt;em&gt;`AppleCIDER &amp;lt;http://www.applecider.org/&amp;gt;`__&lt;/em&gt;, a local Apple Computer
Users Group.&amp;nbsp; They demonstrated a little desktop 3D printer that they
had built themselves.&amp;nbsp; I was blown away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew about
&lt;em&gt;`Stereolithography &amp;lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereo_lithography&amp;gt;`__&lt;/em&gt;
and CAD (&lt;em&gt;`Computer-aided
design &amp;lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAD&amp;gt;`__&lt;/em&gt;).&amp;nbsp; Xerox engineers had
made rapid prototypes using that technology for decades.&amp;nbsp; But specialist
operated those machines, and they had&amp;nbsp;talent and training that I didn’t
have. &amp;nbsp;Furthermore, the machines cost more money than an individual
could afford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, people are building these little machines that can even build parts
to replicate themselves.&amp;nbsp; And people are sharing their designs and
discoveries for other people to build upon.&amp;nbsp; The source code for
anything built on these little industrial robots can be shared online at
a site called Thingiverse.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They call the shared technology
&lt;em&gt;`RepRap &amp;lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reprap&amp;gt;`__&lt;/em&gt; for replicating rapid
prototyping.&amp;nbsp; The designs are evolving unbelievably fast because people
are sharing with each other!&amp;nbsp; What a sobering thought!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t plan to get any more patents.&amp;nbsp; Now I have a reprap machine, and
I have joined the&amp;nbsp;people who share ideas in a Hackerspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I used to think of hackers as being the bad guys who stole identities
and maliciously created computer viruses and things like that.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; Now it
has come to mean people who take an existing good idea and hack on it to
make it better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_1420&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignright&amp;quot;
width=&amp;quot;277&amp;quot;]&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/04/HandleStand.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="HandleStand" class="wp-image-1420" src="/wp-uploads/2013/04/HandleStand.jpg" style="width: 277px; height: 311px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; iPad on a HandleStand[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, I have hacked-up an iPad accessory that I call the
HandleStand.&amp;nbsp; I took a protective&amp;nbsp;iPad case that I bought on Amazon for
$8 and hacked it.&amp;nbsp; I drilled two holes and attached a pair of hinged
handles to it with screws.&amp;nbsp; The case I chose also allows me to attach a
Keyboard that protects the front of my iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The handles open up to make a stand that allows the iPad to tilt at any
angle.&amp;nbsp; Great for making videos or calling people on FaceTime with the
iPad camera that can be pointed in any direction.&amp;nbsp; By the way, it also
holds the iPad at a comfortable eye level just like the vue-stand.&amp;nbsp; But
it is better for all these reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where can you buy this HandleStand and how much does it cost?&lt;/strong&gt;
Sorry, but you can’t buy one.&amp;nbsp; You can get the source code from
&lt;em&gt;`Thingiverse &amp;lt;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:64811&amp;gt;`__&lt;/em&gt; however, and
if you can get access to a 3D printer you can make your own!&amp;nbsp; You can
even hack it to make a better one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t have a 3D printer?&amp;nbsp; Well come on over to INTERLOCK on any
Tuesday or Thursday night and we will help you hack one up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must admit that getting these little printers to run is&amp;nbsp;a bit tricky
sometimes.&amp;nbsp; They are complex electronic devices that run on an open
source micro-controller called
&lt;em&gt;`Arduino &amp;lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino&amp;gt;`__&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The hardware and
software are made from the contributions of many-many people, and
instructions don’t necessarily keep up with the latest developments. A
lot of things can go wrong, and Murphy’s law does apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But hackerspaces are springing up all around the world where people help
each other with things like that.&amp;nbsp; So you should join the world of
hardware hackers.&amp;nbsp; Free CAD software has gotten so easy to use now that
even I could learn it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty soon most people will know how to design using CAD just like now
most people can make Powerpoint presentations.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps it won’t be long
before most people will have access to a 3D printer.&amp;nbsp; I built one from a
kit for a little over $500.&amp;nbsp; Or you can get a MakerBot already assembled
for $2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I no longer spend a lot of money trying to sell inventions, I give
them away and save a lot of money.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; My designs can no longer be stolen
from me.&amp;nbsp; I’m publishing the source codes on Thingiverse and I am happy
that people are downloading them for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People tell me that &lt;strong&gt;I’m missing an opportunity to make money on my
inventions…&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t care.&amp;nbsp; I’m an inventaholic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="HandleStand, 2" class="aligncenter wp-image-1357" src="/wp-uploads/2013/04/HandleStand-2.jpg" style="width: 529px; height: 596px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is an Open-Source design, and the STL files can be downloaded
from Thingiverse: &amp;nbsp;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:64811&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;* &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The HandleStand&amp;nbsp;is hacked from an inexpensive protective case by
adding a pair of 3D printed handles.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/04/Stand-and-case.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Stand and case" class="aligncenter wp-image-1381" src="/wp-uploads/2013/04/Stand-and-case.jpg" style="width: 424px; height: 291px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the name implies, the accessory provides both a handle and a stand
function for the iPad, but it is also quite portable, and the handle can
be folded out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/04/smart-cover-3.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="smart cover 3" src="/wp-uploads/2013/04/smart-cover-3-300x251.jpg" style="width: 216px; height: 181px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="keyboard 1" src="/wp-uploads/2013/04/keyboard-1-168x300.jpg" style="width: 168px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="keyboard folded" src="/wp-uploads/2013/04/keyboard-folded-300x261.jpg" style="width: 155px; height: 136px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The assembly also accommodates a shoulder strap, a magnetically
attached &amp;quot;Smart Cover&amp;quot; or keyboard.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;* &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The A Frame stand gets the iPad screen up to a comfortable eye level.
&amp;nbsp;A recent study at Harvard concludes: &amp;quot;Head and neck posture during
tablet computing can be improved by placing the tablet higher to avoid
low gaze&amp;nbsp;angles (i.e. on a table rather than on the lap) and through the
use of a case that provides optimal viewing angles.&amp;quot;
&amp;nbsp; &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://iospress.metapress.com/content/x668002xv6211041/fulltext.pdf"&gt;http://iospress.metapress.com/content/x668002xv6211041/fulltext.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/04/ergonomic-stand.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="ergonomic stand" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1371" src="/wp-uploads/2013/04/ergonomic-stand.jpg" style="width: 670px; height: 204px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;* &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;* &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;But how can I print a handle big enough for an iPad on my little
printer that has a 6&amp;quot; x 6&amp;quot; bed?&amp;quot; you ask.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/04/solvent.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="solvent" class="size-medium wp-image-1296 aligncenter" src="/wp-uploads/2013/04/solvent-225x300.jpg" style="width: 225px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well the answer is: &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;solvent bonding&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;... &amp;nbsp;I use Oatey cleaner that
is sold in hardware stores to be used on plastic plumbing pipes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The trick is to design the device in pieces that are small enough to
be printed, and they**&amp;nbsp;also must fit together precisely&lt;/strong&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Then you
print them in ABS plastic which can be &lt;strong&gt;bonded with solvent&amp;nbsp;to form a
solid piece of plastic&lt;/strong&gt;!* (Please see the WARNING below!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/04/Exploded-1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Exploded 1" class="size-medium wp-image-1300 aligncenter" src="/wp-uploads/2013/04/Exploded-1-300x170.png" style="width: 300px; height: 170px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * ** * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I carry my HandleStand with me everywhere!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/04/Travel-with-MacBot.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Travel with MacBot" class="aligncenter wp-image-1387" src="/wp-uploads/2013/04/Travel-with-MacBot.jpg" style="width: 311px; height: 415px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With the HandleStand, an iPad can be adjusted to any position about
the horizontal or vertical axis, so it is great for FaceTime or shooting
video.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/04/HandleStand-as-tripod.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="HandleStand as tripod" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1346" src="/wp-uploads/2013/04/HandleStand-as-tripod-239x300.jpg" style="width: 239px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iPad is protected when conveniently carried using the handles or
when on a shoulder strap or when folded and stuffed into a backpack or
briefcase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;**Instructions**&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Hinge set 3" class="wp-image-1315 alignleft" src="/wp-uploads/2013/04/Hinge-set-3-300x204.png" style="width: 168px; height: 114px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/04/Handle-set.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Handle set 1" class="wp-image-1316 alignleft" src="/wp-uploads/2013/04/Handle-set-300x212.png" style="width: 134px; height: 95px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/04/Handle-set.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Handle set 2" class="wp-image-1316 alignnone" src="/wp-uploads/2013/04/Handle-set-300x212.png" style="width: 134px; height: 95px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iPad HandleStand is made up of parts that are small enough to be
&lt;strong&gt;printed in 3 runs on a PrintrBot LC&lt;/strong&gt; (which has a usable print area
of 120mm x 130mm). The plastic parts are solvent bonded to create
handles that are too large to fit on the printer bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hinge Set contains 2 brackets and 2 sets of A-Frame hinge members.
The brackets are screwed onto a polycarbonate protective cover such as
the Poetic Basic Smart Cover Slim-Fit Case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Hinge assembly 2" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1317" src="/wp-uploads/2013/04/Hinge-assembly-2-300x251.png" style="width: 300px; height: 251px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Each bracket is also screwed to a pair of the A-Frame hinge members
with o-rings providing the controlled friction for the hinges.&lt;/strong&gt;
Locknuts insure that the hinges stay adjusted and don’t come off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hinge Set takes about 2hr to print on a Printrbot LC with ABS.
Handles each contain 3 handle parts and a Microbeaner, and they take
about 1hr 20min for each to print (for a &lt;strong&gt;total of about 5hr printing
time&lt;/strong&gt;). ABS is recommended because it allows the parts to be solvent
bonded together. If PLA or other material is used, then superglue
(cyanoacrylate) can be used to bond the parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A shoulder/neck strap that is made from printed “microbeaners” and
Parachord can be attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/04/neckstrap.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="neckstrap" class="aligncenter wp-image-1382" src="/wp-uploads/2013/04/neckstrap.jpg" style="width: 605px; height: 614px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parts list:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/04/parts-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="parts 1" class="aligncenter wp-image-1378" src="/wp-uploads/2013/04/parts-1.jpg" style="width: 687px; height: 605px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-(1) Hinge Set (containing 2 brackets and 4 hinge members).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-(2) Handles (each containing parts for a 3-piece handle and a
MicroBeaner for the shoulder strap).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-(1) Polycarbonate iPad case that snaps on at the corners such
as&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/PoeticBasic-Smart-Cover-Slim-Fit-Crystal/dp/B007JBN6NQ"&gt;amazon.com/PoeticBasic-Smart-Cover-Slim-Fit-Crystal/dp/B007JBN6NQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-(2) Stainless steel 6-32 x ¾” oval phillips machine screw (attach
hinges to brackets)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-(2) flat-head 6-32 x ⅜” machine screw (attach brackets to polycarbonate
case)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-(4) 6-32 lock nuts with nylon inserts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-(4) #6 o-ring provide friction for hinges&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-(4) #41 o-ring provide friction against a table&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-(1) ⅛” parachord &amp;nbsp; 5’ &amp;nbsp;long&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tools:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Drill with ⅛” bit and countersink bit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Solvent to bond ABS such as Oatey cleaner (yellow label white can) made
for ABS plumbing pipe (or use acetone or superglue)... See warning
below!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Use match or lighter to burn the cut ends of parachord&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*WARNING:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Use &lt;strong&gt;CAUTION&lt;/strong&gt; during solvent bonding!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Use &lt;strong&gt;eye protection&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Work in &lt;strong&gt;well ventilated area&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-The solvent dissolves many things, and the &lt;strong&gt;wet plastic stains
whatever it touches&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Use &lt;strong&gt;latex NOT vinyl gloves&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Use &lt;strong&gt;aluminum foil on work surface&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/04/BabyBeaner.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="BabyBeaner" class="aligncenter wp-image-1383" src="/wp-uploads/2013/04/BabyBeaner.jpg" style="width: 451px; height: 354px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Use great care to go back and &lt;strong&gt;coat the whole part for a uniform
glossy finish&lt;/strong&gt; (especially if parts were sanded), but do one end and
hang to dry (for a few minutes) before doing the other end!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-The solvent can also be used to &lt;strong&gt;heal delaminated parts&lt;/strong&gt;, but BE
CAREFUL!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;Countersink the holes&lt;/strong&gt; drilled in the Poetic case so that the screw
heads will not touch the iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-A &lt;strong&gt;large rubber band&lt;/strong&gt; can be added to keep the the Ultrathin Keyboard
or Smart Cover closed while the assembly is being carried around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enjoy the HandleStand!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I was unsure of was the control linkages, and how the
articulation points can be made. &amp;nbsp;It needs to have a few points of
articulation to match the birds in the Enchanted Tiki Room:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qZOD7wBfc5Y/UTdpnqOh8qI/AAAAAAAACXw/r3R4zyJgR7c/s1600/2013-03-06+11.00.15.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qZOD7wBfc5Y/UTdpnqOh8qI/AAAAAAAACXw/r3R4zyJgR7c/s640/2013-03-06+11.00.15.jpg" style="width: 356px; height: 640px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perch rotation - 270 degrees, spins the bird around (not shown)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lean - +20, -20 degrees, to lean forward and backward at the point
where the legs connect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Head yaw - +45, -45 degrees back and forth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Head tilt - +15, -15 degrees up and down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beak - 30 degrees, could be all open or all closed (shown in the
diagram as 15 degrees)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking that after I constructed the foam version, I could figure
things out from there, but after seeing&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hackaday.com/2013/02/28/3d-printed-hog-drive/"&gt;this post on Hack-A-Day with
a &amp;quot;HOG Drive&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;,
I realized I could leverage off of this design for the head linkages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chatted with Skip at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/"&gt;Interlock&lt;/a&gt;, and
by the end of this last Tuesday evening, I had two 3-D printed versions
of this, using ABS, rather than the PLA material I am
more&amp;nbsp;familiar&amp;nbsp;with. (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:52097"&gt;Here's the Thingiverse link for the
design&lt;/a&gt;.) Since I wasn't
going to be mounting a motor, we (and by &amp;quot;we&amp;quot; I mean &amp;quot;he&amp;quot;) replaced the
motor space with a flat plate with a mounting screw hole. &amp;nbsp;He also
replaced the back control arm with just a peg, since the bridge-like
shape wouldn't hold up properly on his printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-w3-dNOYQiBU/UTdp-unGYKI/AAAAAAAACX4/UgL3sYxLOsc/s1600/2013-03-05+23.23.34.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-w3-dNOYQiBU/UTdp-unGYKI/AAAAAAAACX4/UgL3sYxLOsc/s640/2013-03-05+23.23.34.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first print (on the left) has a failed control peg on the center
disk. &amp;nbsp;It was adding material onto printed material that didn't cool
yet, so it just kinda globbed up. &amp;nbsp;This was improved by Skip by adding a
second post, seen in the second version on the right. &amp;nbsp;He also added
some material around the screw holes in the frame, to improve
durability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After printing and having this in my hand, I'm realizing that it won't
quite work for me, although it does give me an excellent starting point.
&amp;nbsp;The center disk is too small to mount the head on. &amp;nbsp;It's only about 1
1/2 inches in diameter. I think I'd want something about 2-3&amp;quot; in
diameter, with plenty of mounting points and space for securing the head
,as well as space for wiring for the beak servo (or linear motor, or
solenoid, or whatever). &amp;nbsp;It really showed me the design considerations
for actually constructing something, not to mention it
really&amp;nbsp;emphasized&amp;nbsp;that whatever design I can think of, I can print...
which is pretty&amp;nbsp;futuristically&amp;nbsp;awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the important thing is that I know have ideas to build on for the
final version. &amp;nbsp;I'll still be constructing a foam core model, and I'll
be using this above design as a kick-off point.&lt;/p&gt;

motor space with a flat plate with a mounting screw hole. &amp;nbsp;He also
replaced the back control arm with just a peg, since the bridge-like
shape wouldn't hold up properly on his printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-w3-dNOYQiBU/UTdp-unGYKI/AAAAAAAACX4/UgL3sYxLOsc/s1600/2013-03-05+23.23.34.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-w3-dNOYQiBU/UTdp-unGYKI/AAAAAAAACX4/UgL3sYxLOsc/s640/2013-03-05+23.23.34.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first print (on the left) has a failed control peg on the center
disk. &amp;nbsp;It was adding material onto printed material that didn't cool
yet, so it just kinda globbed up. &amp;nbsp;This was improved by Skip by adding a
second post, seen in the second version on the right. &amp;nbsp;He also added
some material around the screw holes in the frame, to improve
durability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After printing and having this in my hand, I'm realizing that it won't
quite work for me, although it does give me an excellent starting point.
&amp;nbsp;The center disk is too small to mount the head on. &amp;nbsp;It's only about 1
1/2 inches in diameter. I think I'd want something about 2-3&amp;quot; in
diameter, with plenty of mounting points and space for securing the head
,as well as space for wiring for the beak servo (or linear motor, or
solenoid, or whatever). &amp;nbsp;It really showed me the design considerations
for actually constructing something, not to mention it
really&amp;nbsp;emphasized&amp;nbsp;that whatever design I can think of, I can print...
which is pretty&amp;nbsp;futuristically&amp;nbsp;awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the important thing is that I know have ideas to build on for the
final version. &amp;nbsp;I'll still be constructing a foam core model, and I'll
be using this above design as a kick-off point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that I've had to do for my re-purposing of the DB15
Stepper Motor controllers is to be able to reliably reprogram them. &amp;nbsp;The
early versions of the programmer consisted of just a wire harness with a
DB-15 connector on one end, and leads that plugged into the headers on a
standard Arduino board. It eventually progressed into an octopus-like
wire harness that used another DB15 as the &amp;quot;host&amp;quot; Arduino. &amp;nbsp;This worked
well, but is cumbersome. &amp;nbsp;In this post, I'll highlight the basic circuit
used, and the procedure for using it, specifically for this controller
board, but the techniques are applicable to other ATmega based micros as
well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZCQSK2Hy--o/USuXT0QgurI/AAAAAAAACT0/1nTzDp29MIM/s1600/2013-02-12+23.39.41.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZCQSK2Hy--o/USuXT0QgurI/AAAAAAAACT0/1nTzDp29MIM/s640/2013-02-12+23.39.41.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The reason for doing all of this work. &amp;nbsp;About 30 or so DB-15 widgets
which can be repurposed as Arduino-compatible microcontroller boards.
&amp;nbsp;They don't have all of the IO that a stock Arduino board has, but if
your device only needs 6 IO (one of which is analog input), with a
potential for another analog input, and 4 more digital outputs with a
little work, they're an excellent free resource at Interlock!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICSP (In-Circuit Serial Programmer) is basically a device that takes
in a firmware image from a host computer, and uses SPI-based
communications with a target device to shove that firmware image into
place. &amp;nbsp;For general Arduino use, you can shove the Arduino serial
bootloader into place. This is about 1k (for the optimized bootloader
aka &amp;quot;Optiboot&amp;quot;) of program space that sits on your micro, next to any
sketch that you download to it. &amp;nbsp;When the Arduino powers up or gets
reset, this small bit of code will check for a new sketch to download.
&amp;nbsp;If it sees something, it will accept it, shove it into program memory
and then run it. &amp;nbsp;If it doesn't, it simply skips over and runs whatever
sketch has already been downloaded there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICSP allows you to program in that bootloader. &amp;nbsp;You can also use it
to program in your sketch, if you need to reclaim that 1kbyte of space.
&amp;nbsp;I'll get into that later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. &amp;nbsp;Let's get into the hardware for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gbxvXGpxJGY/US4q8noQw7I/AAAAAAAACVM/4EcaBPf7WnM/s1600/ArduinoProgrammingHost.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gbxvXGpxJGY/US4q8noQw7I/AAAAAAAACVM/4EcaBPf7WnM/s640/ArduinoProgrammingHost.png" style="width: 616px; height: 640px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Host Connection.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Showing the basic construction for the Arduino-ICSP Host.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wmhtPuM5Y4E/US4q8oSWMVI/AAAAAAAACVE/5d9VSEvJBTY/s1600/D15_To_ArduinoProgrammer.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wmhtPuM5Y4E/US4q8oSWMVI/AAAAAAAACVE/5d9VSEvJBTY/s1600/D15_To_ArduinoProgrammer.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Target connection.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Showing how to hook up the D15 to the programming header above. &amp;nbsp;These
6 lines can also be arranged in the 2x3 layout standard on Arduino
boards as well, or wired directly to ATMega chips for other
applications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Arduino, the pins are mapped as such:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Digital 13: SCLK (Orange)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Digital 12: MISO (Yellow)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Digital 11: MOSI (Violet)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Digital 10: SS (Green) (Wired to RESET for the programmer, DB15 pin
4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The circuit to wire up is pretty easy. &amp;nbsp;On the host, there are three
status LEDs that the packed-in &amp;quot;ArduinoISP&amp;quot; uses. &amp;nbsp;Heartbeat shows you
it's alive, Programming shows you when it's programming a target device,
and Error tells you when something went wrong -- which is also displayed
on the host computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three output should be wired through a 220 ohm resistor, to a LED,
and tied to ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other thing that may be necessary is to disable the reset circuit on
the host Arduino. &amp;nbsp;This is necessary because when the computer connects
to the host Arduino-programmer, that micro will reset, and then quickly
hop into the &amp;quot;check for new firmware over serial for itself&amp;quot; routine, as
explained above. &amp;nbsp;This may often cause failures with the host computer
connecting and communicating with the programmer properly. &amp;nbsp;If you
disable the reset circuit here, it will never fall into this state, and
will remain perfectly stable. &amp;nbsp;The easiest way to disable it, if you're
building it up from scratch, is to disconnect the DTR/Serial based reset
trigger completely, leaving the 10k pullup resistor tied to the
arduino's reset line. &amp;nbsp;However, if you're using a pre-constructed
Arduino as the host, you can simply tie the reset line to +5v through a
120 ohm resistor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connecting the host to the target is also easy. &amp;nbsp;The target device
should be hooked up as a basic arduino -- power, crystal clock, etc. Be
sure that even if they're on separate power supplies, that they at least
have their grounds tied together. &amp;nbsp;For ease of use, just power the
target from the host completely. Past that, simply connect up pins 11,
12, 13 from the host to the target device. &amp;nbsp;This will put both on the
same SPI bus. &amp;nbsp;This is how the data will get sent to the target device.
&amp;nbsp;Basically, this maps out as SPI-MISO, SPI-MOSI, and SPI-CLOCK. &amp;nbsp;The
only other connection you need to do is to hook up pin 10 from the host
computer through to the RESET line of the target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PccHS7Y3pE0/USuU0C6kxoI/AAAAAAAACTA/Etr9RQxqWjU/s1600/2013-01-29+21.44.56.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image4" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PccHS7Y3pE0/USuU0C6kxoI/AAAAAAAACTA/Etr9RQxqWjU/s640/2013-01-29+21.44.56.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Step 1: hook up power, ground, serial IO, and reset circuitry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The reset circuit is a 10k pullup resistor to +5v, and a .1uF cap to
the reset line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Next up will be putting a jumper to disable the reset line as explained
above.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Note: this picture is from a different build but shows the same first
step)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DB15 as seen here has pin 1 on the right. &amp;nbsp;The pins are basically:
1) TX, &amp;nbsp;2) RX, 4) RESET, then +5 and ground on the bottom pins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fjVnBhiYZlg/USuVpGsBK0I/AAAAAAAACTU/wsZe01vZQBY/s1600/2013-02-12+23.42.15.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image5" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fjVnBhiYZlg/USuVpGsBK0I/AAAAAAAACTU/wsZe01vZQBY/s640/2013-02-12+23.42.15.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Red LED is the power indicator. &amp;nbsp;The resistor and cap for the reset
circuit are visible, as is the jumper for disabling reset on the ICSP
widget.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above you can see the version of this board that I fabbed up for
Interlock. &amp;nbsp;It has the FTDI header for connecting to the host computer,
and used a pre-programmed DB-15 widget with the ICSP firmware on it. &amp;nbsp;I
know this sounds like a chicken-and-egg thing, but once you program your
first device using a standard Arduino as the host, it makes sense to
program one of these, and use it to replace that board &amp;nbsp;instead.
(especially when you have ~100 of them to spare. hehe)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blue/white/red/white lines from the ICSP widget are equivalent to
pins 10,11,12,13 on a standard host Arduino, and those go right into the
cable down to the target device. Since pins 9, 8, and 7 were not all
able to be broken out to the LEDs, I had to tweak the sketch a little.
&amp;nbsp;8 is the LED on the ICSP widget itself, which is Yellow. &amp;nbsp;The Yellow
and Green LEDs on the board (along with their current limiting
resistors) are wired up to Analog 2 and Digital 3 (pwm), and these ports
are changed accordingly. &amp;nbsp;8 remains as the error LED, 3 became the green
Heartbeat light, and A2 became the new yellow program light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DFLaZBRh8c4/USuVmPnRu_I/AAAAAAAACTI/iwscZJc6a2U/s1600/2013-02-12+23.40.30.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image6" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DFLaZBRh8c4/USuVmPnRu_I/AAAAAAAACTI/iwscZJc6a2U/s640/2013-02-12+23.40.30.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ready to roll, with a target device plugged in!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note the extra prototyping area. &amp;nbsp;This can be for a ZIF socket in the
future for other devices, etc.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BpRtrMBwj4c/US4q8gyfdSI/AAAAAAAACVI/E2sdLVU5ky0/s1600/D15_to_D15_Programmer.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image7" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BpRtrMBwj4c/US4q8gyfdSI/AAAAAAAACVI/E2sdLVU5ky0/s640/D15_to_D15_Programmer.png" style="width: 570px; height: 640px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The full circuit diagram for the D15-hosted programmer, connected to a
D15 target.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(The wire colors are the same as the above for reference.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this is all wired up, we can get some firmware down onto that
thing. &amp;nbsp;In our case, we have a device that isn't directly supported by
the Arduino IDE, so we need to configure that first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two things need to be installed. First is the board definition, second
is the optiboot hex file. Both of these content files can be grabbed
from my&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/BleuLlama/GeodesicSphere/tree/master/Projects/DB15Arduino"&gt;Geodesic Sphere
repository&lt;/a&gt;.
&amp;nbsp;Full instructions are also there as for specific directories on Windows
and Mac for doing this installation. The &amp;quot;readme&amp;quot; there shows the text
block to drop into your &amp;quot;Boards.txt&amp;quot; file, and where to find that file.
&amp;nbsp;You will also need to drop the optiboot.hex file into the &amp;quot;optiboot&amp;quot;
folder as well. &amp;nbsp;Once these two steps are done, you can start up the
Arduino IDE and you're ready to program. &amp;nbsp;Let's also assume that we've
already externally kickstarted this, and the &amp;quot;Arduino ISP&amp;quot; sketch is
already on the host device, and is running properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's where it gets confusing. &amp;nbsp;What? You're not already confused?
&amp;nbsp;HERE WE GO!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fire up the Arduino IDE, and let's set it for the D15 device. &amp;nbsp;From the
&amp;quot;Tools&amp;quot; menu, select &amp;quot;Serial Port&amp;quot; and select your FTDI interface's
serial port name. &amp;nbsp;Next, from the &amp;quot;Tools&amp;quot; menu, select &amp;quot;ATmega168 at
7372800Hz (D15)&amp;quot; from the &amp;quot;Board&amp;quot; menu. &amp;nbsp;This will tell the IDE what our
target device is. &amp;nbsp;Now, from the &amp;quot;Tools&amp;quot; menu, select &amp;quot;Arduino as ISP&amp;quot;
from the &amp;quot;Programmer&amp;quot; menu. This is all one-time configuration stuff.
&amp;nbsp;Now, you can plug in a target D15 widget to the end of the cable seen
above, and then select &amp;quot;Burn Bootloader&amp;quot; from the &amp;quot;Tools&amp;quot; menu. &amp;nbsp;A bunch
of lights should flash, and you'll end up with the Arduino bootloader on
the target widget!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the above setup, it's wired such that you can also use it to test the
target. &amp;nbsp;Disconnect the FTDI cable, disconnect the ICSP widget, and move
the newly programmed device into the DB15 connector on the board.
&amp;nbsp;Adjust the jumper so that &amp;quot;RESET&amp;quot; is enabled. &amp;nbsp;Now plug the DB15 cable
back in. &amp;nbsp;This is now the equivalent to using the DB15 as a barebones
Arduino. &amp;nbsp;Load up the D15_Test sketch included in the github repository
mentioned above. &amp;nbsp;Click the &amp;quot;upload&amp;quot; arrow button, wait a moment, and
the LED on the target widget should be blinking. &amp;nbsp;That's it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One alternate way you can use this is to program your Arduino code onto
the target widget without installing the bootloader. &amp;nbsp;These widgets use
an ATMega 168, which has very constrained space, so this might be
preferred for larger programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hook it back up in the programmer configuration, with the ICSP widget on
the board, the target on the cable, and the jumper set to disable RESET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Arduino IDE, instead of just clicking the &amp;quot;upload&amp;quot; arrow
button, hold down the [SHIFT] key, and the text will change from
&amp;quot;upload&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;upload using programmer&amp;quot;. &amp;nbsp;It may take a moment longer, but
the end result is that you will see the LED blinking on the target
widget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use this to program other Arduino-like devices too (ATMega,
ATTiny, etc). &amp;nbsp;You will just need to breakout the 6 lines (MOSI, MISO,
CLOCK, RESET, +5v, GROUND) to whatever pin header configuration or
socket is necessary. &amp;nbsp;Then you can just select the target device from
the menu as appropriate (ATmega 168, 328, 5v, 3.3v, etc) and then select
&amp;quot;Burn Bootloader&amp;quot; from the menus as above, and it will put the
appropriate serial bootloader onto the device for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;I wasn't able to make it to their &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ithacagenerator.org/events/open-house/"&gt;open
house&lt;/a&gt; back in
December. But, I&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;did visit with some family over the holidays who were able to go and
got to see the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.evilmadscientist.com/2008/edge-lit-holiday-cards/"&gt;party
favors&lt;/a&gt;
they made at the open house. Fun. Look like good things are in store
for the hands-on, DIY hacker and maker community in Ithaca.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've also been having a friend, Joe, make the trip from Niagara Falls
every so often to visit, which has had us asking how things are going at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.buffalolab.org/blog/"&gt;Buffalo Lab&lt;/a&gt;. Figured we've give
them a shout out while we're at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[placehold for eventual &lt;strong&gt;Rochester Makerspace&lt;/strong&gt; logo]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, but hopefully not least, the most recent big news is a
much-anticipated step for the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rochestermakerspace.org/"&gt;group&lt;/a&gt; calling themselves
Rochester Makerspace. They've rented a space a little north of downtown,
on St. Paul Street. Just Tuesday they had &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rochestermakerspace.org/tuesday-meeting-reminder-pizza-0205/"&gt;a get-together with
pizza&lt;/a&gt;
at the new location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the planning for this new space has been careful and deliberate,
ongoing since at least this last summer, they now are moving towards
ambitious goals to grow fast. I continue eagerly to await the opening of
another maker-friendly space in Rochester, expected some time in March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seen in a previous post, I have a Tron Mini/Cabaret arcade machine.
&amp;nbsp;I used to have a Tron full-sized (FS) machine, but sold it many years
ago. &amp;nbsp;One thing that the FS had over the mini was lots of extra
lighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had artwork beyond the monitor lit with a regular light, it had a
blacklight above the control panel to make the traces glow, and make the
joystick glow. &amp;nbsp;There's also a second blacklight below the control panel
to backlight the bottom portion as well. &amp;nbsp;All of these lights are always
lit, making the machine extra awesome. &amp;nbsp;On the mini, there is glow
artwork, but no light to illuminate them. &amp;nbsp;Ever since the late 90s, I've
had a plan to change this, so I bought a pack of UV LEDs, but they've
sat dormant in my parts bin until now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3PQ37GAflKU/UQllX60VInI/AAAAAAAACRs/6bSx7ymUibk/s1600/91b64d71ed8b3555b56265edc340dccf.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3PQ37GAflKU/UQllX60VInI/AAAAAAAACRs/6bSx7ymUibk/s640/91b64d71ed8b3555b56265edc340dccf.jpg" style="width: 546px; height: 640px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that I'd like to bring to this, is to go an extra step, and
bring some ideas over from the &amp;quot;Environmental Discs Of Tron&amp;quot; (EDOT)
machine. &amp;nbsp;On the EDOT, you walk inside of it... one of the few, if not
the only, games where you can do this. &amp;nbsp;Around the monitor and control
panel are lights, similar to the FS Tron. However, on EDOT, they're
controlled by the game. &amp;nbsp;They will flash and such when certain game
events happen. I can make this happen with Tron, using an interface to
the game, and a ROM hack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above all, the modifications made&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;must be reversible without any
damage to the machine&lt;/strong&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I do not want to inflict any permanent damage
or changes to the cabinet. &amp;nbsp;I will simply add lighting, make a ROM hack
to control the lights, and mount an additional board inside the cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-alUmFfgO7IU/UQllj55GK0I/AAAAAAAACR0/9DRz_vTT-7Y/s1600/2013-01-29+21.45.04.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-alUmFfgO7IU/UQllj55GK0I/AAAAAAAACR0/9DRz_vTT-7Y/s640/2013-01-29+21.45.04.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start with, I need a secondary micro to control the lights. I'll use
one of my stepper motor controller/Arduino devices. I made the FTDI
programming and power interface seen above in about 30 minutes on the
piece of strip board at Interlock this past Tuesday. &amp;nbsp;You can see the
resistor/capacitor pair to handle the programmer's reset, power, and
TX/RX lines, and a red power indicator LED for the heck of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IZXdgylhkJM/UQlmBOhEWjI/AAAAAAAACR8/tgu_9wa8Lcw/s1600/2013-01-29+23.37.25.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image4" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IZXdgylhkJM/UQlmBOhEWjI/AAAAAAAACR8/tgu_9wa8Lcw/s640/2013-01-29+23.37.25.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit more work, I had the 3 LED driver chips wired up, with their
8 outputs, along with the 5 pin header which I'll be using to interface
it with the arcade machine. &amp;nbsp;The pinout there is two bits of input, 5v
power input, and ground. &amp;nbsp;I'll add in SPI-like (clock+data)
communications from the TRON game. &amp;nbsp;I figure that the first version will
just send down a packet stating the lighting effect, but in the future I
can use this to send down high scores as well, which can be sent out via
serial to a host PC and post them on the net or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first it didn't power on properly, and the LED driver chips got VERY
hot. &amp;nbsp;Then I remembered that the circuit diagram I was referring to
while soldering this up was incorrect and had power and ground reversed
to the chip. &amp;nbsp;I also had + and - wired backwards for the LEDs as well. I
forgot that these driver chips sink current, rather than sourcing it.
&amp;nbsp;After a little bit of emergency soldering, all of that got worked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BAv4m00YYho/UQlnQYvBDNI/AAAAAAAACSE/KIVSIgF94PA/s1600/2013-01-30+00.07.36.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image5" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BAv4m00YYho/UQlnQYvBDNI/AAAAAAAACSE/KIVSIgF94PA/s640/2013-01-30+00.07.36.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I've since cleaned up the wiring a bit, adding some insulation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to wire up the LEDs such that the current limiting resistor
was wired up with the LEDs, rather than on the main board. &amp;nbsp;I'm glad I
did this, as the resistance I picked (220 ohms) was way too high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YhLD_7PXFZI/UQlnzncUnXI/AAAAAAAACSU/RoJJSDb4td4/s1600/2013-01-30+01.39.00.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image6" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YhLD_7PXFZI/UQlnzncUnXI/AAAAAAAACSU/RoJJSDb4td4/s640/2013-01-30+01.39.00.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enhanced image. It sadly doesn't look quite this intense in person.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oE-ZamW4Z-Y/UQloCRkoH5I/AAAAAAAACSc/pEc8tMDBtXE/s1600/2013-01-30+01.40.49.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image7" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oE-ZamW4Z-Y/UQloCRkoH5I/AAAAAAAACSc/pEc8tMDBtXE/s640/2013-01-30+01.40.49.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Experimenting with how it will look to have LEDs inside of the joystick
to illuminate it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output from these LEDs was much dimmer than I was hoping for. I will
be experimenting with lower-valued resistors, as well as possibly
doubling-up LEDs for lighting the various artwork elements. &amp;nbsp;I also need
to figure out how to mount the LEDs without damaging the machine at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up is the ROM hack to talk with this!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm in the process of constructing/setting up my office in the house,
and for lighting, I have decided that I want to use xmas light-style
lighting. &amp;nbsp;Many years ago, I used to light my room with
multicolored&amp;nbsp;incandescent&amp;nbsp;lights. I loved the warm indirect glow, and
smooth light without a single light source. &amp;nbsp;This time, I'm going to
take it a step further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there's nothing about this project yet that is really innovative
over what others have done, it is the first step to getting the office
lighting done. &amp;nbsp;The real fun will come into play once I'm able to hang
this up, and start programming effects, and tying those effects in to
physical or time-based events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple years back I picked up a strand of addressable LED lights,
similar to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://adafruit.com/products/322"&gt;this one, available at
adafruit.com&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I got a strand of
50 lights, blew out one of them while being stupid, and used a few of
them in Jasper's Toy Box (posts to come about that eventually), so I'm
left with 42 lights. &amp;nbsp;A nice number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any event, the plan is to hang them up around the upper perimeter of
the room, and it will give a nice comfortable glow to illuminate the
room. &amp;nbsp;I can also extend it by doing lighting effects with the color.
&amp;nbsp;For example, in the evening I can have all of them dim blue, and
randomly twinkle one to white, to simulate a star in the sky. &amp;nbsp;I could
also tie them in to an automation system to glow a particular corner of
the room red or yellow when i have email from a specific person. &amp;nbsp;I
could also adjust their color based on the content of my monitor, or the
light outisde, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic design for the control circuitry is that there will be
an&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://arduino.cc/"&gt;Arduino-based&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;AVR micro (actually&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://geodesicsphere.blogspot.com/2012/11/reverse-engineering-stepper-motor_5.html"&gt;one of
the D-15 servo controllers I've
appropriated&lt;/a&gt;),
which is perfect, since the strands only need two lines to control them.
&amp;nbsp;The host computer will send down codes to address the LEDs (set all to
color X, set led Y to color X, etc) and this will pass on the content to
the strand, and twiddle the data lines and all of that fun stuff. &amp;nbsp;I had
considered putting more &amp;quot;smarts&amp;quot; into the micro, but the amount of space
in there would severely limit the kind of content I could &amp;quot;display&amp;quot;, so
I decided to put all of the grunt work back on the host computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uM2j8G4bmkI/UQAByR5gu9I/AAAAAAAACMs/VDXCsItz4Y8/s1600/2013-01-22+20.57.51.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uM2j8G4bmkI/UQAByR5gu9I/AAAAAAAACMs/VDXCsItz4Y8/s640/2013-01-22+20.57.51.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To power it, I needed to get a 5 volt power supply. I snagged a power
brick from an old external drive case, as well as a standard PC power
connector, from a failed power supply, and spliced the two of them
together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0Lk4XPmclbQ/UQAB5hIWmkI/AAAAAAAACM0/kjh75lnZnPI/s1600/2013-01-22+21.08.04.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="aligncenter" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0Lk4XPmclbQ/UQAB5hIWmkI/AAAAAAAACM0/kjh75lnZnPI/s640/2013-01-22+21.08.04.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 454px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copious, yet appropriate amounts of heat shrink tubing and splicing some
wires yielded a nice power supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qRuJm5PwJS8/UQACEt5W8LI/AAAAAAAACM8/DRBHdWGILGk/s1600/2013-01-22+22.17.59.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qRuJm5PwJS8/UQACEt5W8LI/AAAAAAAACM8/DRBHdWGILGk/s640/2013-01-22+22.17.59.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I built an interface board to tie it all together. &amp;nbsp;The ports on
the board are (left to right) - 6 pin FTDI interface for serial IO, 2
pin jumper (power the D15 from the power supply rather than FTDI
source), 3 pin power, 4 pin light strand connector. &amp;nbsp;You can also see in
this picture, the process of crimping the terminals for the molex
connector on the LED strand's wires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept the layout and pinout of the FTDI the same as I used for&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://geodesicsphere.blogspot.com/2012/12/prototype-elias-serial-network-node.html"&gt;my
serial node
experiment&lt;/a&gt;.
&amp;nbsp;This will help me plug that connector in correctly. &amp;nbsp;I&amp;nbsp;still&amp;nbsp;need to
add visual cues (colored sharpie markings) to help me align the pins
correctly. &amp;nbsp;The power connector has GND on pins 1 and 3, and +5V on pin
2. &amp;nbsp;Keeping it symmetrical will help me always plug it in correctly,
reducing the chance that I will blow it all up. &amp;nbsp;The 4 pin connector is
the same pinout as the wiring of the LEDs. &amp;nbsp;GND, Data, Clock, +5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sn6v9P3L0Ck/UQDMlTmqFZI/AAAAAAAACOk/auhjvIBC_9w/s1600/2013-01-24+00.12.35.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image4" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sn6v9P3L0Ck/UQDMlTmqFZI/AAAAAAAACOk/auhjvIBC_9w/s640/2013-01-24+00.12.35.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jumper on the board (dis)connects the power header from the D15 and
FTDI portion. &amp;nbsp;If I make standalone firmware for it, I can power
everything from the power supply, if need be. The tiny green LED on the
board just lights when the D15 has power. &amp;nbsp;A nice indicator in case
everything else is not functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protocol I used for this is very simple. &amp;nbsp;There's a command
character sent through serial, then the data for that command. &amp;nbsp;If the
firmware is expecting a command character but gets something it doesn't
understand, it just keeps checking the serial input for a command it
knows. &amp;nbsp;The protocol is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;p&amp;lt;index of LED&amp;gt;&amp;lt;red value&amp;gt;&amp;lt;green value&amp;gt;&amp;lt;blue value&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five bytes. &amp;nbsp;It sets the specified LED (0..42 in this case) with the
specified RGB value (0..255 each). &amp;nbsp;Note that this is not an ascii
string, it is data. &amp;nbsp;So no matter what, it is 5 bytes to change a single
pixel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;f&amp;lt;red value&amp;gt;&amp;lt;green value&amp;gt;&amp;lt;blue value&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Force all of the lights to the specified color. &amp;nbsp;This is handy for
clearing everything to black, or flashing/fading effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/BleuLlama/GeodesicSphere/tree/master/Projects/AddressableLEDStrip"&gt;Here's the Arduino firmware used to handle all of
this&lt;/a&gt;:
&amp;nbsp;(Note: it requires that the strand's library be installed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hvlLzR8S3ew/UQAGvMGSVII/AAAAAAAACNc/H5LFUVdgCZ0/s1600/2013-01-23++1.27.57+AM.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image5" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hvlLzR8S3ew/UQAGvMGSVII/AAAAAAAACNc/H5LFUVdgCZ0/s400/2013-01-23++1.27.57+AM.png" style="width: 400px; height: 358px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, that's it. &amp;nbsp;I made&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/BleuLlama/GeodesicSphere/tree/master/Projects/AddressableLEDStrip"&gt;a simple interface on the desktop side in
Processing&lt;/a&gt;,
adapted from&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://geodesicsphere.blogspot.com/2012/10/a-computer-controllable-pixel.html"&gt;my previous controllable pixel
software&lt;/a&gt;,
to let me click and change the color of an LED. I also added some key
commands to do simple effects with the lights. (all red/green/blue.
flash, etc)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BduKt0WqcQ4/UQAI-6l9X_I/AAAAAAAACN8/47UV5TsPbA4/s1600/2013-01-23+01.32.06+HDR.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image6" class="aligncenter" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BduKt0WqcQ4/UQAI-6l9X_I/AAAAAAAACN8/47UV5TsPbA4/s640/2013-01-23+01.32.06+HDR.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I will write better desktop software which will use the LEDs
for indication of events, as well as f.lux style color effects
throughout the day, audio/visual synchronization to media being played,
and other effects as well as time goes on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOTE: All of the source/projects for this are&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/BleuLlama/GeodesicSphere/tree/master/Projects/AddressableLEDStrip"&gt;available on

&lt;p&gt;I won't lie to you. &amp;nbsp;Having an arcade machine is a lot of fun. &amp;nbsp;I used
to have about 6 of them, but I'm down to two, due to space restrictions
and general sanity. &amp;nbsp;The two that I still have are a TRON Mini/Cabaret,
and a generic full-size cabinet …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MTbnJ9YpTcg/UPbXP5-Qt9I/AAAAAAAACLs/btDXSoM82CI/s1600/2013-01-15+23.57.19.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" class="aligncenter" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MTbnJ9YpTcg/UPbXP5-Qt9I/AAAAAAAACLs/btDXSoM82CI/s640/2013-01-15+23.57.19.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't lie to you. &amp;nbsp;Having an arcade machine is a lot of fun. &amp;nbsp;I used
to have about 6 of them, but I'm down to two, due to space restrictions
and general sanity. &amp;nbsp;The two that I still have are a TRON Mini/Cabaret,
and a generic full-size cabinet into which I can put one of a few game
motherboards that I have. (Dig Dug, Mortal Kombat, Klax, Rampart, and a
few others.) &amp;nbsp;But one of the less&amp;nbsp;glamorous&amp;nbsp;sides of collecting machines
is troubleshooting and repairing these 30 year old beasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought the Tron Mini in the late 90s as an empty cabinet. &amp;nbsp;I was
having a difficult time back then finding an affordable Tron
board/control set to install, so I instead put Satan's Hollow into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ts-AO60eYo8/UPbSm_i9GtI/AAAAAAAACKo/IF8KBNpNU80/s1600/20001107_0011.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ts-AO60eYo8/UPbSm_i9GtI/AAAAAAAACKo/IF8KBNpNU80/s400/20001107_0011.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tron Cabaret cabinet with Satan's Hollow - Note the red joystick and
white &amp;quot;shield&amp;quot; button instead of the standard blue stick and spinner
from Tron.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, I found all of the parts needed including a few tricks to
restore this. &amp;nbsp;When I put the Satan's Hollow boardset in, I
rewired/hacked/brutalized the wiring in the cabinet to&amp;nbsp;accommodate&amp;nbsp;SH.
&amp;nbsp;Although SH used the same boardset, the controls were wired
differently. &amp;nbsp;Once I got the Tron board, and realized how rare this
machine really is, I re-wired it using a wire harness from a junked Tron
machine. &amp;nbsp;I also found the correct power supply to install, repaired by
a fellow collector. &amp;nbsp;The controls were also out of another junked
machine. &amp;nbsp;Over time, I got the machine as restored as I could get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tron uses a boardset, three boards connected together, from Bally/Midway
called &amp;quot;MCR-2&amp;quot;. &amp;nbsp;It consists of a CPU/Program board, a Video/Graphics
board, and a Sound/IO board. &amp;nbsp;Midway used this boardset for a few games,
including Tron, Satan's Hollow, Two Tigers, and a couple other ones. &amp;nbsp;If
you have a ROM programmer (which I do), you can buy one of the cheaper
boardsets to use as a replacement for one of the more desirable
machines. &amp;nbsp;Tron boardsets, when I was last looking, sold for about
$75-$150. &amp;nbsp;Two Tigers sold for about $40. &amp;nbsp;The boardset I have Tron
running on right now is a Two Tigers boardset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When restoring a game, there's a line to walk with respect to what parts
to put into it. &amp;nbsp;This machine has some vinyl veneer on the sides, which
are somewhat damaged. &amp;nbsp;It also has a fair bit of wear on the front edge
of the control panel. &amp;nbsp;I could have tracked down a
replacement/reproduction for these parts, but I'd rather keep it factory
original. &amp;nbsp;It's not like the damage is too severe for either issue. &amp;nbsp;I'm
actually very happy with the overall condition.... &amp;nbsp;except for the
monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cabaret/mini cabinet uses a 13&amp;quot; monitor, compared with the
full-size's 19&amp;quot; monitor. &amp;nbsp;The monitor on this one showed a wavy haze,
distorting the image a little, and mucking with the brightness across
the screen, which &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YytR8kJBrPw"&gt;you can kinda see in this
video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was given a solution&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.umlautllama.com/Image/2001/01/cap/"&gt;about 11 years
ago&lt;/a&gt;, involving
modifying one of the boards in the monitor (the &amp;quot;neck board&amp;quot;, which
connects directly to the back of the picture tube) but never did it, and
lost the parts a few years ago. &amp;nbsp;I instead&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amusementsplus.com/"&gt;bought a &amp;quot;cap kit&amp;quot; from
Amusements Plus&amp;nbsp;around 3 years ago&lt;/a&gt;,
and decided to&amp;nbsp;install&amp;nbsp;it. &amp;nbsp;The last time I did one of these was in
2001, so it's been some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kD3CON3lFA0/UPbVkLIgBJI/AAAAAAAACLM/IOI-CpSvJ34/s1600/2013-01-15+21.24.08.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kD3CON3lFA0/UPbVkLIgBJI/AAAAAAAACLM/IOI-CpSvJ34/s640/2013-01-15+21.24.08.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 476px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Love that desoldering iron! &amp;nbsp;The pump just clears out all of the solder
super fast!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gcGkwIIbCms/UPbVvRPQguI/AAAAAAAACLU/5TOutBy7rnc/s1600/2013-01-15+22.08.33.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gcGkwIIbCms/UPbVvRPQguI/AAAAAAAACLU/5TOutBy7rnc/s640/2013-01-15+22.08.33.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of the caps in the cap kit have been replaced. &amp;nbsp;Shiny new caps on
the board. &amp;nbsp;Old, dusty, puffy caps in the plastic bag. &amp;nbsp;I'm not entirely
sure why I kept them...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the awesome desoldering tool
at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/"&gt;Interlock&lt;/a&gt;, I was able to do this in
about 45 minutes, rather than the 3 hours it took me years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9CZk6B8II_g/UPbWLVXCodI/AAAAAAAACLc/lNHRuaus464/s1600/2013-01-15+23.41.43.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image4" class="aligncenter" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9CZk6B8II_g/UPbWLVXCodI/AAAAAAAACLc/lNHRuaus464/s640/2013-01-15+23.41.43.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The board is mounted into the monitor framework, and reconnected to the
picture tube.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;|image5|&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kOw2tsVd-hY/UPbXzemPFaI/AAAAAAAACMA/cexxzopC0Ms/s1600/2013-01-16+01.11.27.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image6" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kOw2tsVd-hY/UPbXzemPFaI/AAAAAAAACMA/cexxzopC0Ms/s320/2013-01-16+01.11.27.jpg" style="width: 239px; height: 320px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just about all of these knobs needed to be tweaked to get the picture
looking its best!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some calibration of adjusting all of the controls (focus and drive
on the flyback transformer, and R/G/B Drive and Cutoffs on the neck
board), the picture looked better than it has ever looked before! Which
you can't really tell from these pictures, but trust me, the picture is
sharp, colors bright, and the imagery is stable. It's like it's a new
monitor!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JX1z847H4jI/UPbW4VBYEjI/AAAAAAAACLk/dupw1sy-okw/s1600/2013-01-15+23.49.41.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image7" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JX1z847H4jI/UPbW4VBYEjI/AAAAAAAACLk/dupw1sy-okw/s640/2013-01-15+23.49.41.jpg" style="width: 478px; height: 640px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The boardset I had in it at first was the Satan's Hollow with my ROM
hack so that it will work as a drop-in for TRON arcade cabinets with no
rewiring at all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-C9tTnXwNreQ/UPbXP5ca0vI/AAAAAAAACLw/4Fskp5j7TB0/s1600/2013-01-16+00.15.21.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image8" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-C9tTnXwNreQ/UPbXP5ca0vI/AAAAAAAACLw/4Fskp5j7TB0/s640/2013-01-16+00.15.21.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yeah, a horrible high score, but just let me practice and
remember&amp;nbsp;`my old
strategies &amp;lt;http://www.csh.rit.edu/~jerry/arcade/tron/&amp;gt;`__!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The above pictures were taken before I realized how much dust had
accumulated on the picture tube and shroud. &amp;nbsp;I've since removed the
artwork glass as well as the tinted plexi below that, and cleaned off
those items as well as the picture tube itself. &amp;nbsp;That eliminated all of
the haze, and improved the picture as well!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, I'll get 30 more years of life out of if!&lt;/p&gt;

work on, I have a bunch of little things I want to get done. &amp;nbsp;They have
the tools and materials I often need to do this. &amp;nbsp;This past Tuesday was
one such night. &amp;nbsp;I had four things I wanted to work on, and I got all
four done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:&lt;/strong&gt; I like to put handles on things. &amp;nbsp;My favorite handles are from
Lowes or Home Depot, and are called &amp;quot;wire drawer pulls&amp;quot; as seen in the
image above. &amp;nbsp;They're relatively inexpensive at about $2, and are simple
to install. &amp;nbsp;Generally they would be put on drawers in a modern kitchen
or a clinical-type setting, but I like to put them on everything. &amp;nbsp;If
something is portable, it should have a handle. &amp;nbsp;I just drilled two
small holes in the plastic parts bin seen above, shoved the screws in
from behind with some washers, and done! &amp;nbsp;I've used these handles for
portable drive carriers, and other now-more-portable things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-A2jqRHKGfyg/UMn5KGoxLGI/AAAAAAAACFk/H8Gbj2G43sA/s1600/2012-12-11+20.56.15.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-A2jqRHKGfyg/UMn5KGoxLGI/AAAAAAAACFk/H8Gbj2G43sA/s400/2012-12-11+20.56.15.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 298px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2:&lt;/strong&gt; My son, Jasper sometimes breaks his toys. &amp;nbsp;I usually am the one
who fixes them. &amp;nbsp;Above are two wood bolts from his workbench. &amp;nbsp;The
threaded screws came out of the bolt heads. &amp;nbsp;I just scraped out the glue
from the holes, and cleaned up both sides with a rasp and some other
things that probably weren't designed for such things. &amp;nbsp;I added some
wood glue, threw them in these clamps, and returned the screws to Jasper

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3:&lt;/strong&gt; I had tried to fix my DLP projector a few weeks back. &amp;nbsp;There was
something in the light path making half of the image dim such that if
you shook the projector, it would clear up a little. I tore it down, and
right between the spinny color wheel and the mirrors in front of the DLP
chip is this little mirror tube collimator. The glue holding the four
front-surface mirrors to the rectangular metal box had failed, and the
mirrors became loose. &amp;nbsp;A couple weeks back, I had tried gluing it back
together with epoxy, and it seemed to work, but a new, harsher shadow
was in the projected image. &amp;nbsp;I needed to get some dental tools, mainly
the little mirror tool, to see what was going on. &amp;nbsp;Sure enough, this
little guy was aligned incorrectly. &amp;nbsp;A bunch of futzing with it later,
and it is now fully functional!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4:&lt;/strong&gt; I have been building little breakout boards for my stepper motor
controller-turned-arduino boards. &amp;nbsp;I decided that for the animatronic
bird project, I wanted to have a way to input joystick data. &amp;nbsp;I made a
small adapter to go from PC Gameport Joystick to the widget.&amp;nbsp;`&amp;nbsp;I
followed this project
here &amp;lt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.built-to-spec.com/blog/2009/09/10/using-a-pc-joystick-with-the-arduino/"&gt;http://www.built-to-spec.com/blog/2009/09/10/using-a-pc-joystick-with-the-arduino/&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;`__&amp;nbsp;for
the correct circuit -- basically just some pullups on the digital button
inputs, and some pulldowns for the analog axis inputs. &amp;nbsp;I only wired up
the first X/Y pair as the widgets only have two analog inputs available.
&amp;nbsp;It was relatively simple to build. &amp;nbsp;I had built the main breakout board
the night before at home, and i made the orange-wire to Gameport
connector cable at Interlock. &amp;nbsp;With help from Nick, providing the old
joystick, before I left i had written an auto-scaling display of the
current joystick state. &amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;More about this to come in future posts&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, it was a densely packed evening, with four mini-projects
completed. &amp;nbsp;Huzzah!&lt;/p&gt;

is a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_forming"&gt;vacuum forming
tool&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;To be honest,
I've wanted one since I read an article on the web about how to make
your own Stormtrooper costume in the late 1990s. &amp;nbsp;It now seemed like a
good time to make one, as I'd like to use it for producing the bird
parts, and it seems pretty straightforward, so within a week, I was
at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/"&gt;Interlock&lt;/a&gt;, crafting up a vacuum
plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic design I'm going with for the vacuum plate/box&amp;nbsp;is a small box,
with a shopvac connector on the bottom, pegboard as the top, screwed
together, and metal foil taped to seal air gaps. &amp;nbsp;This is sort of a
mixture of a few different designs&amp;nbsp;I've&amp;nbsp;found on the net. &amp;nbsp;The material
will go on its own frame, heated by a heat gun, then pushed down onto
the vacuum frame, with the shop vac turned on. &amp;nbsp;The softened material
will get sucked in tight against the mold, forming it into that shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hbkJ1mtbEcs/UL-_Wgg1u4I/AAAAAAAACC0/xerinbr9PXs/s1600/IMG_1964.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hbkJ1mtbEcs/UL-_Wgg1u4I/AAAAAAAACC0/xerinbr9PXs/s400/IMG_1964.JPG" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic frame is 12&amp;quot; square. &amp;nbsp;I cut the pegboard to 12&amp;quot;x12&amp;quot;, and I cut
a scrap of wood to 12&amp;quot;x14&amp;quot; for the base. &amp;nbsp;I made this one larger so I
could clamp it to a desk to keep it stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4kgtwJwBiYg/UL-_XJfMW6I/AAAAAAAACC8/dCMFqoPAklE/s1600/IMG_1965.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4kgtwJwBiYg/UL-_XJfMW6I/AAAAAAAACC8/dCMFqoPAklE/s400/IMG_1965.JPG" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the frame of the base, I ripped some 2x4 pieces into 2x2 ish stock.
&amp;nbsp;To make this easier to assemble, I made four of these, cut to 10 1/2&amp;quot;
long, and arranged them so that they butt up against the others, as seen
in the picture above. &amp;nbsp;They went together fairly cleanly, but there were
some air gaps, but this isn't important as the foil tape will seal it up
later. &amp;nbsp;I specifically wasn't concerned about tolerances on this as I
knew the tape would cover it anyway. &amp;nbsp;The stock is held together using
metal brackets, also seen in the above picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8-MM72N65BU/UL-_YL79NUI/AAAAAAAACDE/izu1UOnXXlQ/s1600/IMG_1967.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8-MM72N65BU/UL-_YL79NUI/AAAAAAAACDE/izu1UOnXXlQ/s400/IMG_1967.JPG" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The base plate got a 2 1/2&amp;quot; diameter hole in it to accept the shop vac
hose. &amp;nbsp;I would have used a hole cutter to do this, but I didn't have
one. &amp;nbsp;Instead, I drilled a pilot hole and used a scroll saw to cut out
the hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DtNSJ742Clc/UL-_Y0t_S4I/AAAAAAAACDM/VSP2y4vg6SU/s1600/IMG_1969.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DtNSJ742Clc/UL-_Y0t_S4I/AAAAAAAACDM/VSP2y4vg6SU/s400/IMG_1969.JPG" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frame is then screwed to the base plate (pre-drilling all holes, of
course) and to the pegboard using drywall screws, AKA the &amp;quot;duct tape of
screws&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UnLOF4acukc/UL-_ZdJ_DGI/AAAAAAAACDQ/JAskrC2gAp0/s1600/IMG_1973.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image4" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UnLOF4acukc/UL-_ZdJ_DGI/AAAAAAAACDQ/JAskrC2gAp0/s400/IMG_1973.JPG" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next comes the foil tape to seal it up.&amp;nbsp;Finally some door weather
stripping to act as a good seal with the material frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JeBVTGeTK4A/UL-_Z8kPLOI/AAAAAAAACDc/lR72LIkHEpY/s1600/IMG_1974.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image5" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JeBVTGeTK4A/UL-_Z8kPLOI/AAAAAAAACDc/lR72LIkHEpY/s400/IMG_1974.JPG" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The material frame was made with some 1x2 stock or whatever this was,
from the scrap pile. &amp;nbsp;It was simply drilled and screwed together with
more... drywall screws!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kLZM6qhBDt8/UL-_cCU7tOI/AAAAAAAACDs/Az9mpjdvlvQ/s1600/IMG_1988.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image6" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kLZM6qhBDt8/UL-_cCU7tOI/AAAAAAAACDs/Az9mpjdvlvQ/s400/IMG_1988.JPG" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The material is taped to the frame (for now... in the future, I'll build
a better, less cumbersome way to secure the material.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xS3GfdHJFJU/UL-_cqN6V3I/AAAAAAAACD0/3imKVG31wmA/s1600/IMG_1992.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image7" class="aligncenter" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xS3GfdHJFJU/UL-_cqN6V3I/AAAAAAAACD0/3imKVG31wmA/s400/IMG_1992.JPG" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I heated it with a heat gun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UHG5XenE6tA/UL-_dINg1HI/AAAAAAAACD8/eCvcQ7u4i-I/s1600/IMG_1995.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image8" class="aligncenter" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UHG5XenE6tA/UL-_dINg1HI/AAAAAAAACD8/eCvcQ7u4i-I/s400/IMG_1995.JPG" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was time, the&amp;nbsp;shop vac&amp;nbsp;went on, and I lowered the framed
material down onto the plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... How did it work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not great. &amp;nbsp;It was&amp;nbsp;ridiculously&amp;nbsp;difficult to get the material heated
consistently and hot enough. &amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;heat gun&amp;nbsp;would burn a hole through the
material if left in one place, but the material cooled off too quickly
if you moved away from it for too long. &amp;nbsp;I need to build a heater rig to
prepare the material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eJFRXNSEJKI/UL-_ekV3DJI/AAAAAAAACEM/O1sO0CMSA-g/s1600/IMG_1998.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image9" class="aligncenter" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eJFRXNSEJKI/UL-_ekV3DJI/AAAAAAAACEM/O1sO0CMSA-g/s400/IMG_1998.JPG" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attempted to re-heat the material with hopes of getting it hot enough
to pull in, while the vacuum was on. &amp;nbsp;It helped a little, but was quite
tricky to work with. &amp;nbsp;I then removed the foamcore miniature arcade
machine, and continued, thinking its height might be an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5EipH73NrAk/UL-_fb7GZaI/AAAAAAAACEU/7P3lAK65QK8/s1600/IMG_2003.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image10" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5EipH73NrAk/UL-_fb7GZaI/AAAAAAAACEU/7P3lAK65QK8/s400/IMG_2003.JPG" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I overheated some of it, melting through the plastic sheet. &amp;nbsp;Oops. &amp;nbsp;But
you can clearly see the Duplo blocks, and the stupid Jar-Jar in the
plastic. &amp;nbsp;Unfortunately, Jar-Jar made it unscathed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I wasn't expecting was the odor of the plastic, especially
this green plastic seen above. MAN, does it smell horrible. &amp;nbsp;When you
see people mentioning &amp;quot;work in a well&amp;nbsp;ventilated&amp;nbsp;area&amp;quot; they aren't
kidding. The plastic continued to have a foul odor for a few hours after
it cooled down. I had to drive home
from&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/"&gt;Interlock&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;with my windows down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It shows promise, but it's not quite there yet. &amp;nbsp;I wouldn't call it a
success, but I wouldn't call it a failure either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recently had &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/Rob_Bishop"&gt;Rob Bishop&lt;/a&gt; from the
Raspberry Pi foundation stop by Interlock and give a workshop for a
couple of hours, and as we scrambled to prepare -- attempting to pull
together 20 hdmi monitors, 20 usb keyboards, 20 power supplies, et
cetera -- I kept thinking that it'd be nice to be able to play around
with a Pi even if you've arrived unprepared for such an event. So what
follows is &amp;quot;how to fiddle with the Pi GUI with just your laptop, an
ethernet cable, and a micro USB cable&amp;quot;. We're going to start with a
freshly imaged SD card, hook it up to a Mac or Ubuntu laptop through
their internet sharing capabilities, and use VNC to share the GUI over
the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/8248698572/"&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG_4611.jpg" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8209/8248698572_2f0cac271c_z.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="getting-started"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step we'll gloss over is copying a fresh Raspbian image onto
an SD card. This is covered in great detail at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup"&gt;the embedded Linux
wiki&lt;/a&gt;, where they have
plenty of information on setting up the Raspberry Pi. Go there, follow
along, and insert your newly imaged card into your Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="internet-sharing"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Internet Sharing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we're going to prep our laptop to share its internet connection
with the Pi. I know nothing about Windows, but on Ubuntu and Mac OSX,
there are easy ways to share your wifi connection with any computers
that are hooked up to your ethernet port. We'll take these one OS at a
time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/8247471395/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screen shot 2012-12-05 at 4.25.15 PM" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8478/8247471395_775221feba_z.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 490px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming your Mac is connected to a wireless access point, open up the
&amp;quot;Sharing&amp;quot; control panel in System Preferences. Click on the &amp;quot;Internet
Sharing&amp;quot; option, which is probably grayed out at this point. Choose
&amp;quot;Ethernet&amp;quot; as the port you'll share your internet connection out of, and
then turn on Internet Sharing by clicking its checkbox, which should now
be clickable. Done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/8248822966/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot - 12052012 - 07:15:23 PM" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8197/8248822966_1eae0b1a48_o.png" style="width: 434px; height: 325px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This step is equally easy on Ubuntu (and its variants... I use Xubuntu).
Open up the &amp;quot;Network Connections&amp;quot; system preferences. You'll see
something like the above screenshot. Click the big &amp;quot;+ Add&amp;quot; button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/8248822932/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot - 12052012 - 07:16:31 PM" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8339/8248822932_8d72c9e608_o.png" style="width: 409px; height: 464px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll be confronted with something like the above. Name this new
connection something logical. &amp;quot;Connection Sharing&amp;quot; works for my brain.
Click over to the &amp;quot;IPv4&amp;quot; tab and select &amp;quot;Shared to other computers&amp;quot; from
the &amp;quot;method&amp;quot; dropdown. Some people have reported problems with IPv6 at
this point, so click over to that tab and select &amp;quot;Ignore&amp;quot; in the same
dropdown. Save the connection. Carry on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="plugging-in"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Plugging In&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we should be back on the same page for both OSes. Find the shortest
ethernet cable you can and plug your Pi into your laptop's ethernet
port. Nothing should happen. Plug the USB cable into your laptop, and
then into the micro USB port on the Pi. Before doing so, reflect upon
the fact that &lt;strong&gt;the Pi foundation does not recommend you power your Pi
off of a computer's USB port&lt;/strong&gt;. Your computer might not be able to
supply enough power, and/or might burst into flames. I've not had any
such problems, but if your Pi is acting flaky, or if you're planning on
plugging any USB peripherals into the Pi, you may want to sacrifice
MacGyver points and portability in favor of a wall outlet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="sleuthing-ips"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sleuthing IPs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok. We're plugged in with internet tubes and power. Your Pi should be
booting up and making happy blinkies on its status LEDs. After a short
while, it's safe to assume that it has fully booted and grabbed an IP
address from your laptop. Hooray! Open up a terminal and perform the
following incantations to find out what address it was assigned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/8247609327/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screen shot 2012-12-05 at 6.12.15 PM" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8349/8247609327_22f78a3375_o.png" style="width: 585px; height: 366px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Mac, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;cat /private/var/db/dhcpd_leases&lt;/tt&gt; should pop up a block
of text with the desired info. Above, we got an address of 192.168.2.2.
That's probably pretty standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/8247755603/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot - 12052012 - 07:23:02 PM" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8069/8247755603_c53afc8561_o.png" style="width: 600px; height: 414px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Ubuntu Linux, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;cat /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases&lt;/tt&gt; will get you the
same info. In this case, our IP is 10.42.0.26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ssh-and-setting-up-a-vnc-server"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SSH, and Setting Up a VNC Server&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a few more steps. We need to SSH into the Pi. That is, we need to
connect to a command shell on the Pi so we can install a few things to
get our display up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;ssh pi&amp;#64;x.x.x.x&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Substitute the IP you found previously for all the x.x.x.x mayhem at the
end there. It should connect and ask you for the default password, which
is &amp;quot;raspberry&amp;quot;. Now install the vnc server. This is what will transmit
the desktop environment to your laptop:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;apt-get&lt;/span&gt; install tightvncserver&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the VNC server once, and it will ask you to set a password:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;vncserver&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set and remember a password when it prompts you. I just used &amp;quot;raspberry&amp;quot;
again. I'm creative like that. Now we'll run the VNC server for real:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;vncserver :1&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;:1&amp;quot; is the display number. This is necessary because you could
serve multiple virtual displays off of one computer. But lets not get
ahead of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="installing-a-vnc-client"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installing a VNC Client&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're now ready to install the VNC client on our laptop and connect to
the Pi's GUI. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cotvnc/"&gt;Chicken of the
VNC&lt;/a&gt; is a popular Mac
client. Download and install that as per normal. On Ubuntu,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://projects.gnome.org/vinagre/"&gt;Vinagre&lt;/a&gt; is probably the most
popular client. &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;apt-get&lt;/span&gt; install vinagre&lt;/tt&gt; should get it installed
without a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/8248539760/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screen shot 2012-12-05 at 4.52.36 PM" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8065/8248539760_33c9b1642b_o.png" style="width: 509px; height: 314px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost there. Above is the Chicken of the VNC connection dialog. Fill in
the IP address you found previously, and the &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; display number and
password. Click connect and you should be up and running! On Ubuntu, the
command &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;vinagre x.x.x.x:1&lt;/tt&gt; will do the same thing. Yay! You're done.
Celebrate your hard work and dedication while admiring your glorious
accomplishment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/8248701138/"&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG_4617.jpg" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8208/8248701138_078e58a0be_z.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="extra-credit"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Extra Credit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fellow Interlock member
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://geodesicsphere.blogspot.com"&gt;BleuLlama&lt;/a&gt; suggested a way to
make this process a bit easier the second time around. Rather than
hunting down the Pi's IP address (which is admittedly not very difficult
to do), we can use Apple's Bonjour protocol (aka ZeroConf) to have the
Pi announce itself to the network. I found a good writeup on how to do
this, plus how to get the VNC server to start automatically on boot.
Check it out &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4dc5.com/2012/06/12/setting-up-vnc-on-raspberry-pi-for-mac-access/"&gt;at Pat Galea's
blog&lt;/a&gt;.
You can ignore the part about installing Netatalk unless you care about
Mac file sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you're done with your extra credit, you'll have a Pi that you can
plug into your ethernet and USB ports, wait a minute or two, and it'll
pop up automatically in Chicken of the VNC or Vinagre (or any Bonjour
enabled VNC client, of course).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

quickly approaching, I needed to do something about it. &amp;nbsp;The push button
for the start/stop function has been getting harder and harder to use.
&amp;nbsp;In the past, I've cracked it open and cleaned out the pad underneath
the rubberized button membrane, but this time, doing this didn't work. I
also &amp;nbsp;wanted a more permanent fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-W2RX7bp_FDQ/ULTZfXs02OI/AAAAAAAAB-k/J9ZA4wveUHw/s1600/l_6x6x9mm-tactile-push-button-switch-momentary-x200-a97d.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-W2RX7bp_FDQ/ULTZfXs02OI/AAAAAAAAB-k/J9ZA4wveUHw/s320/l_6x6x9mm-tactile-push-button-switch-momentary-x200-a97d.JPG" style="width: 320px; height: 320px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to replace the membrane switch for that function with one of
these tactile buttons. &amp;nbsp;I just had to make sure that the solder pads
would line up. &amp;nbsp;I worked out an orientation in which the solder pads
would match the pushbutton pads, as you can see in the next image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5CeberbMixw/ULTZM7UihAI/AAAAAAAAB-I/wLUai6clHPo/s1600/2012-11-20+22.05.48.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5CeberbMixw/ULTZM7UihAI/AAAAAAAAB-I/wLUai6clHPo/s400/2012-11-20+22.05.48.jpg" style="width: 298px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only issue is that rather than the rubber membrane sitting flush
with the board, it now had to&amp;nbsp;accommodate&amp;nbsp;the shape and size of the
switch along with the button which extended out quite far. &amp;nbsp;I used a
pair of diagonal cutters to nip away at the rubber from behind to recess
the switch into the button itself, Ben Heck style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EEh7ZDp8H7o/ULTZNu0snjI/AAAAAAAAB-Q/1oGXGXTRpho/s1600/2012-11-20+22.08.16.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EEh7ZDp8H7o/ULTZNu0snjI/AAAAAAAAB-Q/1oGXGXTRpho/s400/2012-11-20+22.08.16.jpg" style="width: 298px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see this in the top right of the gray membrane. &amp;nbsp;The two contact
pads have been removed, and instead there is the hole, into which the
switch recesses. &amp;nbsp;The hole was made fairly crudely, but it works!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hS3feisTxMk/ULTZOc3WfZI/AAAAAAAAB-Y/-IID8imYNqI/s1600/2012-11-20+22.17.39.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hS3feisTxMk/ULTZOc3WfZI/AAAAAAAAB-Y/-IID8imYNqI/s320/2012-11-20+22.17.39.jpg" style="width: 239px; height: 320px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been accidentally abused over the years, and as a result, the
screws on the bottom no longer hold it together as the plastic has
broken enough. &amp;nbsp;The strip of electrical tape around the base does well
to hold it together while still looking super stylish! NOTE: It's not
actually very stylish, but rather, functional and should last for many
years more to come. &amp;nbsp;No reason to throw it out, when an hour or so of
work will get it fully functional again!&lt;/p&gt;

BNC is a process that acts in a similar manner to a proxy: I connect to
it, and it connects to the IRC network. The advantage of this, for me,
is that it can stay connected to the network even when I'm not: logging
conversations and messages and holding on to my nickname for me.&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/11/linkinus2.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="IRC" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1084" src="/wp-uploads/2012/11/linkinus2-300x189.png" style="width: 300px; height: 189px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I initially started with a blank slate: an install of Ubuntu Server
12.04 LTS in a virtual machine (thanks to our wonderful netadmin team).
Almost immediately I realized I had a problem though: the VM was behind
a firewall and NAT, with only a single firewall rule and port forward
for SSH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our members recently sent out a message to our mailing list about
doing some cool things with SSH. So I thought it would be a great
opportunity to take advantage of this new knowledge. In order to set
this up, I needed to have SSH open and accessible on another machine.
For convenience sake, I made this the machine that I was going to
connect to the BNC from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this article, I'm going to refer to the two
computers in question as &amp;quot;bwvm&amp;quot; which is the Ubuntu Server virtual
machine, and &amp;quot;bwhome&amp;quot; which is my MacBook Pro on my desk (&amp;quot;bw&amp;quot; being my
initials -- clever, I know).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did was setup SSH keys so that I didn't have to use
passwords when connecting back and fourth between these two computers.
I've done this a few times before but it isn't something I do on a daily
basis, so I followed this excellent guide from Paul Keck on doing so:
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulkeck.com/ssh/"&gt;HOTWO: set up ssh keys&lt;/a&gt;. The gist is that
you generate a public/private key-pair on each computer
(&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;ssh-keygen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-t&lt;/span&gt; dsa&lt;/tt&gt;) and then copy the contents of the resulting
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;id_dsa.pub&lt;/tt&gt; public key file to the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;authorized_keys2&lt;/tt&gt; file on the
opposite computer (i.e. bwvm's &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;id_dsa.pub&lt;/tt&gt; contents go into bwhome's
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;authorized_keys2&lt;/tt&gt; file). Now I can SSH back and fourth freely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next step: install and configure a BNC. At first I started with psyBNC.
I ran into some troubles with that though, in that for some reason it
would only allow me to use super insecure passwords (instead of the
insanely complex ones that I'd generated with
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword"&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt;) and it refused to
connect to some of the IRC servers I wanted to connect to. I spent some
time troubleshooting but ultimately decided it wasn't worth
the&amp;nbsp;hassle&amp;nbsp;and went with a recommendation to use an easier to configure
BNC: ZNC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I got ZNC installed and configured and began the process of forwarding
the port via SSH. The command I'm using to do so looks like this:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;ssh bwhome &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-R&lt;/span&gt; 4242:localhost:31337 &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;When run from a shell on bwvm what this does is links port 31337 on
bwvm to port 4242 on bwhome (which to me is localhost -- the computer
I'm sitting at). So what I can do now is &amp;nbsp;run a
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;/connect localhost 4242&lt;/tt&gt; in my IRC client, and be connected to the
BNC running on port 31337 on bwvm without bugging the netadmin team
for another port forward and firewall rule!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;This is a bit convoluted, but works. At the moment, the process looks
like this (sitting at bwhome):&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;`` &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:me&amp;#64;bwhome"&gt;me&amp;#64;bwhome&lt;/a&gt;:~$ ssh bwvm &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:me&amp;#64;bwvm"&gt;me&amp;#64;bwvm&lt;/a&gt;:~$ ssh bwhome -R 4242:localhost:31337 -N &amp;amp; [switch back to bwhome] me&amp;#64;bwhome:~$ irssi /connect localhost 4242 (BNC password)&amp;nbsp;``&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;Instead I'd like to simply run one command from bwhome, without having
to initiate a shell session with bwvm. This should be possible by
simply switching some of the command around. To do that it will likely
end up looking something like this (again, sitting at bwhome):&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;ssh bwvm &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-L&lt;/span&gt; 4242:localhost:31337 &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-N&lt;/span&gt; &amp;amp;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;(actually it looks exactly like that)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One distinct advantage of this method (using SSH) over having a firewall
rule and a port forward is an added layer of security: in order to
access my BNC someone would have to be able to SSH into my VM. Note that
I don't have to use SSL when connecting to the BNC, because all of the
traffic is already tunneled over SSH.&lt;/p&gt;

BNC is a process that acts in a similar manner to a proxy: I connect to
it, and it connects to the IRC network. The advantage of this, for me,
is that it can stay connected to the network even when I'm not: logging
conversations and messages and holding on to my nickname for me.&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/11/linkinus2.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="IRC" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1084" src="/wp-uploads/2012/11/linkinus2-300x189.png" style="width: 300px; height: 189px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I initially started with a blank slate: an install of Ubuntu Server
12.04 LTS in a virtual machine (thanks to our wonderful netadmin team).
Almost immediately I realized I had a problem though: the VM was behind
a firewall and NAT, with only a single firewall rule and port forward
for SSH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our members recently sent out a message to our mailing list about
doing some cool things with SSH. So I thought it would be a great
opportunity to take advantage of this new knowledge. In order to set
this up, I needed to have SSH open and accessible on another machine.
For convenience sake, I made this the machine that I was going to
connect to the BNC from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this article, I'm going to refer to the two
computers in question as &amp;quot;bwvm&amp;quot; which is the Ubuntu Server virtual
machine, and &amp;quot;bwhome&amp;quot; which is my MacBook Pro on my desk (&amp;quot;bw&amp;quot; being my
initials -- clever, I know).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did was setup SSH keys so that I didn't have to use
passwords when connecting back and fourth between these two computers.
I've done this a few times before but it isn't something I do on a daily
basis, so I followed this excellent guide from Paul Keck on doing so:
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulkeck.com/ssh/"&gt;HOTWO: set up ssh keys&lt;/a&gt;. The gist is that
you generate a public/private key-pair on each computer
(&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;ssh-keygen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-t&lt;/span&gt; dsa&lt;/tt&gt;) and then copy the contents of the resulting
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;id_dsa.pub&lt;/tt&gt; public key file to the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;authorized_keys2&lt;/tt&gt; file on the
opposite computer (i.e. bwvm's &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;id_dsa.pub&lt;/tt&gt; contents go into bwhome's
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;authorized_keys2&lt;/tt&gt; file). Now I can SSH back and fourth freely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next step: install and configure a BNC. At first I started with psyBNC.
I ran into some troubles with that though, in that for some reason it
would only allow me to use super insecure passwords (instead of the
insanely complex ones that I'd generated with
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword"&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt;) and it refused to
connect to some of the IRC servers I wanted to connect to. I spent some
time troubleshooting but ultimately decided it wasn't worth
the&amp;nbsp;hassle&amp;nbsp;and went with a recommendation to use an easier to configure
BNC: ZNC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I got ZNC installed and configured and began the process of forwarding
the port via SSH. The command I'm using to do so looks like this:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;ssh bwhome &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-R&lt;/span&gt; 4242:localhost:31337 &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;When run from a shell on bwvm what this does is links port 31337 on
bwvm to port 4242 on bwhome (which to me is localhost -- the computer
I'm sitting at). So what I can do now is &amp;nbsp;run a
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;/connect localhost 4242&lt;/tt&gt; in my IRC client, and be connected to the
BNC running on port 31337 on bwvm without bugging the netadmin team
for another port forward and firewall rule!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;This is a bit convoluted, but works. At the moment, the process looks
like this (sitting at bwhome):&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;`` &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:me&amp;#64;bwhome"&gt;me&amp;#64;bwhome&lt;/a&gt;:~$ ssh bwvm &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:me&amp;#64;bwvm"&gt;me&amp;#64;bwvm&lt;/a&gt;:~$ ssh bwhome -R 4242:localhost:31337 -N &amp;amp; [switch back to bwhome] me&amp;#64;bwhome:~$ irssi /connect localhost 4242 (BNC password)&amp;nbsp;``&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The result:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;img alt="Yay! IRC goodness" src="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s12/sh/69f51770-2020-4b17-b4a1-2b9c4ff9cec8/804981870bec3e00fb98da354041f354/res/319665fe-898d-4ba9-bb62-63820bff07f6/skitch.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post will continue where that one left off. &amp;nbsp;I'll walk through some
of the process to hopefully get to a solution that works...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yjVkgyfT8Ao/UKHVQYVDczI/AAAAAAAAB78/5ApnGVPQ5Z8/s1600/2012-11-12+23.56.10.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yjVkgyfT8Ao/UKHVQYVDczI/AAAAAAAAB78/5ApnGVPQ5Z8/s320/2012-11-12+23.56.10.jpg" style="width: 273px; height: 320px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize the overall project; &amp;nbsp;I want to build a device that will
illuminate an UV light-erasable ROM (EPROM) device, and also dump out
its contents. I will then take the contents, display them as a graphic,
and animate them over time as the bits fade away into an erased
oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ptkXdzVAcIg/UJqOvYeUR5I/AAAAAAAAB6k/R7b3MIyQJVA/s1600/2012-11-07+11.35.20.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ptkXdzVAcIg/UJqOvYeUR5I/AAAAAAAAB6k/R7b3MIyQJVA/s400/2012-11-07+11.35.20.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 387px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we last left this, the above circuit was what I was going
to work with. &amp;nbsp;The Arduino would shift out a 16 bit address, which will
be stored in the 74HC595 serial-in, parallel-out shift registers. &amp;nbsp;Those
would out&amp;nbsp;I was all set to place the order, but then I started thinking
about other ways to sample the data, and then it hit me...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late 1980s, I had an Amiga 1000 computer (see previous post about
restoring it). &amp;nbsp;We used Macintosh SE computers in High School, and as a
result, we bought the&amp;nbsp; &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://crossconnect.tripod.com/AMAXHIST.HTML"&gt;&amp;quot;AMAX&amp;quot; Macintosh emulation system for the Amiga&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;It was a lot
easier to carry a floppy or two, rather than a SE or SE/30 in a plastic
milk crate, not to mention that MacWrite was a substantially better word
processor than TextCraft. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMAX consisted of software you run that emulated the Mac's hardware, as
well as a &amp;quot;cartridge&amp;quot; that plugged into the floppy drive port of the
Amiga. &amp;nbsp;I remember hearing that they went with the floppy drive port
because it was the only appropriate port identical on all Amigas that
were available at the time. (Amiga 1000, 500, 2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cartridge served two functions. First, it let you plug in a Mac
floppy drive right into the Amiga so that you could read and write 800k
Mac floppies directly. &amp;nbsp;There was something about Amiga drives and Mac
drives supporting a different number of drive speeds, so full
Mac&amp;nbsp;compatibility&amp;nbsp;on the Amiga's drives was directly impossible. &amp;nbsp;Future
versions of AMAX that used an internal card on the Amiga 2000 worked
around this issue. &amp;nbsp;It was possible to make a floppy that supported just
the sectors/speeds that were the same on both, but they only stored 272k
of content. &amp;nbsp;But I digress...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other function of the cartridge was that you needed to plug in Mac
roms into it, which the software would read in as it starts. &amp;nbsp;Rather
than storing the ROM on the Amiga, this protected the copyrights or
whatever. &amp;nbsp;But the important thing here is the function. &amp;nbsp;I had picked
up a few AMAX cartridges for $2 apiece at the awesome&amp;nbsp; &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.activesurplus.ca/en/"&gt;Active Surplus on Queen Street in Toronto&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;a bunch
of years back, so I dug one out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7Q7anY45dnM/UJyUgpiEVAI/AAAAAAAAB7M/U3p_sw6izzM/s1600/2012-11-08+22.59.34.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7Q7anY45dnM/UJyUgpiEVAI/AAAAAAAAB7M/U3p_sw6izzM/s640/2012-11-08+22.59.34.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 401px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Left-to-Right, you see: Amiga D23 floppy connector, for connecting it to
your Amiga, two 28 pin rom sockets, two 74LS393s, one 74LS165, a
resistor, some diodes, a 74LS139, the Mac D19 floppy connector on the
bottom, then the Amiga D23 floppy connector for adding additional Amiga
floppy drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-18w4vJIID1g/UJyU1jLxhdI/AAAAAAAAB7c/kg4tRl3TVUk/s1600/2012-11-08+23.53.05.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-18w4vJIID1g/UJyU1jLxhdI/AAAAAAAAB7c/kg4tRl3TVUk/s640/2012-11-08+23.53.05.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 476px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've started to trace out the circuit, but it became obvious quickly
that it was optimized for board layout rather than what I would consider
to be a sane arrangements of data lines. &amp;nbsp;For example the 8 data output
lines of the ROMs go into the 74LS165 PISO shift register out of order,
so they need to be reshuffled once captured in the host computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead I decided to desolder the chips! &amp;nbsp;My guess at the original
function is something like: the Amiga issues a clear to the 74LS393
binary counter chips, ganged together to yeield a 16 bit output, rather
than two dual-4 bit outputs. &amp;nbsp;This will reset their 16 bit output value
to 0. &amp;nbsp;The 74LS165 parallel-in, serial-out register then latches the 8
bit output from the ROM, and provides it through shifting to the Amiga
via the floppy port. &amp;nbsp;From there, you need to simply pulse the clock on
the '393, and it will&amp;nbsp;increment&amp;nbsp;through every address. Then you just
latch and shift in the data. There's also a 74LS139 demultiplexer, which
might be responsible for sequencing through those events, or perhaps
something to do with the Mac floppy drive. I had a slight mishap and
lost the 74LS165, which is okay since I didn't need it for this project
anyway. &amp;nbsp;Regardless, $2 plus some time -- I'm already ahead and I
haven't even removed the D23s yet (which are the same size as Amiga RGB
Video connectors! Perfect for another project...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yKqJsMVndpk/UJyU-0ld6vI/AAAAAAAAB7k/ytWr1Yz9T1A/s1600/2012-11-08+23.54.08.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image4" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yKqJsMVndpk/UJyU-0ld6vI/AAAAAAAAB7k/ytWr1Yz9T1A/s640/2012-11-08+23.54.08.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 476px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For fun, here's the board with no components on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yPhGkww2fo0/UJx-TvHFDFI/AAAAAAAAB64/ZW5j5cNhgYY/s1600/2012-11-08+21.56.26.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image5" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yPhGkww2fo0/UJx-TvHFDFI/AAAAAAAAB64/ZW5j5cNhgYY/s320/2012-11-08+21.56.26.jpg" style="width: 320px; height: 210px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a slight change in gears I can adapt my design to use the
parts I now have in my toolbox thanks to my desoldering tools. &amp;nbsp;Instead
of the Arduino shifting out an address, it will instead do the process
described above. &amp;nbsp;It will first clear the 393s, then alternately cycle
between clocking out a pulse to increment their values, and reading in
the value directly. Since I'm accessing the ROM data from start to
finish, sequentially anyway, this solution works out perfectly. &amp;nbsp;I also
show four LEDs in the above diagram. Three for various status, one for
UV illumination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cWIzW2S6maY/UKPpxw8t2JI/AAAAAAAAB9I/0FMuEhfRqEg/s1600/2012-11-13+22.30.40.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image6" class="aligncenter" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cWIzW2S6maY/UKPpxw8t2JI/AAAAAAAAB9I/0FMuEhfRqEg/s640/2012-11-13+22.30.40.png" style="width: 426px; height: 640px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a close up of a 27C128 part. This one has Pac-Man programmed
onto it... of course. &amp;nbsp;You can see through the quartz window, and down
onto the EPROM silicon itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Nkxzmx4wLjA/UKRyi43rfVI/AAAAAAAAB9g/KBX-JvT5krk/s1600/2012-11-14+23.16.29.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image7" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Nkxzmx4wLjA/UKRyi43rfVI/AAAAAAAAB9g/KBX-JvT5krk/s400/2012-11-14+23.16.29.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 268px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we see the pins on the Arduino, and how the connect to the shield's
bus connections, along with the LEDs. &amp;nbsp;I could draw this up in a
computerey drawing program, but sketching it out in Sharpie on graph
paper is just&amp;nbsp;quicker... and more Mimsian. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-A1qXIZxizuU/UKRyoHy1G0I/AAAAAAAAB9o/y9jV7rs69_0/s1600/2012-11-14+23.16.36.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image8" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-A1qXIZxizuU/UKRyoHy1G0I/AAAAAAAAB9o/y9jV7rs69_0/s400/2012-11-14+23.16.36.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 247px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the &amp;nbsp;two 74LS393's. &amp;nbsp; You can see their connection to the
address lines on the ROM, as well as the cascading of the counter, e.g.
from 1QD to 2A, and from 2QD to 1A on the second chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ouX_QPqw_mU/UKRyskKJwEI/AAAAAAAAB9w/LgIR8UIhkcc/s1600/2012-11-14+23.16.44.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image9" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ouX_QPqw_mU/UKRyskKJwEI/AAAAAAAAB9w/LgIR8UIhkcc/s400/2012-11-14+23.16.44.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 250px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the wiring for the 28 pin socket, including the 3 pin (two-way)
jumper so that i can use smaller 24 pin parts as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the UV illumination... &amp;nbsp;The data sheets for the EPROMs show that
they should be erased with 253.7 nanometer light, at 15-20 minutes,
2.5cm distance at 15 Watt/seconds per cm^2. &amp;nbsp;I dont know how to measure
this with respect to LEDs, but I'm going to just wing it and see what
happens. &amp;nbsp;The sheet also says that 253.7nm is the optimal wavelength for
erasing them, but anything below 400nm should work. &amp;nbsp;I believe the UV
LEDs I have are somewhere between 350nm and 400nm, so it should work.
&amp;nbsp;The other issue is that the LEDs are substantially less powerful,
probably a tenth to a hundredth the power. We'll see once we get this
going, but I expect it will take on the order of weeks to erase a rom,
rather than minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good thing about this project, in comparison to using EPROMs
functionally, is that you want speed of erasure for functional use. &amp;nbsp;I
personally found that my eraser worked on most of the devices I own in
about 10 minutes. &amp;nbsp;I would often have a chip or two in the eraser, while
programming and debugging others. &amp;nbsp;It worked out fairly well. &amp;nbsp;For this
project, it's&amp;nbsp;completely&amp;nbsp;okay if it takes on the order of hours to erase
a device. &amp;nbsp;I'll find out how well it works once I get it going. &amp;nbsp;I may
use more than one LED just to speed it up a little, in case it takes on
the order of days instead of minutes or hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7pdS0XmtszQ/UKPeqW1OBtI/AAAAAAAAB8Q/s9vl4QBZE_U/s1600/2012-11-10+00.56.30.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image10" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7pdS0XmtszQ/UKPeqW1OBtI/AAAAAAAAB8Q/s9vl4QBZE_U/s400/2012-11-10+00.56.30.jpg" style="width: 298px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started laying out the board at home, wiring in just the LEDs, and
figuring out the best layout for the chips. &amp;nbsp;I used the `&amp;nbsp;DIY shield for Arduino from AdaFruit.com &amp;lt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/187"&gt;https://www.adafruit.com/products/187&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;`__&amp;nbsp;as the
foundation to build this upon. &amp;nbsp;I wanted to leave space for possibly
using larger chips in the future, so what is the bottom of the board
here has space for a few extra data lines if i re-route that red power
line. &amp;nbsp;The '393's are layed out so that the one on the right, which
addresses bits A0-A7 has four of its lines directly lined up. &amp;nbsp;This was
to try to make it a little easier to wire up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6xhutFXwlfI/UKPfE_04XSI/AAAAAAAAB8g/h03Dg45PIk0/s1600/2012-11-14+02.07.22.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image11" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6xhutFXwlfI/UKPfE_04XSI/AAAAAAAAB8g/h03Dg45PIk0/s320/2012-11-14+02.07.22.jpg" style="width: 239px; height: 320px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought some wire wrap wire for address, data, and
control lines, and did most of the work of wiring those up&amp;nbsp; &lt;a class="reference external" href="/"&gt;one evening at Interlock&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I used red for
control (counter clear, clock data cascade lines) as well as eprom
address lines. &amp;nbsp;I used blue for data lines. &amp;nbsp;In the above pictures you
can see how the wires were routed around (there was some more writing on
the bottom, obviously.) You can also see how the UV LEDs are mounted
with some stiff solid core wire. &amp;nbsp;I reduced the number of LEDs to two
plus the UV LEDs for no real reason at all. &amp;nbsp;(There is an Arduino
underneath there somewhere...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the two images above, you can see a jumper on the left of the first
image, bottom of the second image... this changes what one pin is used
for. &amp;nbsp;For smaller EPROMs, pin 26 of the 28 pin footprint is used for
VCC, powering the chip. &amp;nbsp;In the larger packages, VCC is moved to pin 28,
and pin 26 is used for Address line 13. &amp;nbsp;It's confusing. &amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ah_ZDi13ZcngdFlfcDJHWERpNUVGMlBYR0dvdE1kdnc"&gt;A table that shows all of the pinouts&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;doesn't
really help too much, but it was necessary so that I could figure things
out for wiring it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YTbYoRlJDnQ/UKPfF034T1I/AAAAAAAAB8s/NsEVhDXgH9M/s1600/2012-11-14+02.17.32.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image13" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YTbYoRlJDnQ/UKPfF034T1I/AAAAAAAAB8s/NsEVhDXgH9M/s400/2012-11-14+02.17.32.png" style="width: 400px; height: 340px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next is firmware. I wrote a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.umlautllama.com/rand/ROM-Project-Arduino.txt"&gt;pretty simple program for the Arduino&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that
simply enables the EPROM, resets the counters, then clocks through the
addresses, reads them in and sends that data down through the serial
link. &amp;nbsp;After getting the enable lines wrong (active low, rather than
active high), I managed to get it spitting out actual accurate ROM
contents. &amp;nbsp;As you can see in the above, it read out of the ROM (right
half) 0xf3, 0x3e, 0x00, and so on. &amp;nbsp;In a disassembly of Ms PacMan on the
left, you can see these bytes in cyan, just to the right of the red
numbers 0000, 0001, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other half is a simple program that runs on a host computer that
simply reads in serial data and logs it out to a file. &amp;nbsp;That content
looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've now had this running for 12 hours with no change in the bits at
all. &amp;nbsp;I'm thinking that it will require running for upwards of a week or
two to have any affect on bits. &amp;nbsp;I may need to just drop the Arduino and
ROM shield into my eraser to get the results I'm looking for... or at
least a &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; to prove that the idea has a chance of working from
here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If nothing else, I now have a way to read EPROMS from an Arduino.
&amp;nbsp;Awesome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize the overall project; &amp;nbsp;I want to build a device that will
illuminate an UV light-erasable ROM (EPROM) device, and also dump out
its contents. I will then take the contents, display them as a graphic,
and animate them over time as the bits fade away into an erased
oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ptkXdzVAcIg/UJqOvYeUR5I/AAAAAAAAB6k/R7b3MIyQJVA/s1600/2012-11-07+11.35.20.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ptkXdzVAcIg/UJqOvYeUR5I/AAAAAAAAB6k/R7b3MIyQJVA/s400/2012-11-07+11.35.20.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 387px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we last left this, the above circuit was what I was going
to work with. &amp;nbsp;The Arduino would shift out a 16 bit address, which will
be stored in the 74HC595 serial-in, parallel-out shift registers. &amp;nbsp;Those
would out&amp;nbsp;I was all set to place the order, but then I started thinking
about other ways to sample the data, and then it hit me...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late 1980s, I had an Amiga 1000 computer (see previous post about
restoring it). &amp;nbsp;We used Macintosh SE computers in High School, and as a
result, we bought the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://crossconnect.tripod.com/AMAXHIST.HTML"&gt;&amp;quot;AMAX&amp;quot; Macintosh emulation system for the
Amiga&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;It was a lot
easier to carry a floppy or two, rather than a SE or SE/30 in a plastic
milk crate, not to mention that MacWrite was a substantially better word
processor than TextCraft. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMAX consisted of software you run that emulated the Mac's hardware, as
well as a &amp;quot;cartridge&amp;quot; that plugged into the floppy drive port of the
Amiga. &amp;nbsp;I remember hearing that they went with the floppy drive port
because it was the only appropriate port identical on all Amigas that
were available at the time. (Amiga 1000, 500, 2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cartridge served two functions. First, it let you plug in a Mac
floppy drive right into the Amiga so that you could read and write 800k
Mac floppies directly. &amp;nbsp;There was something about Amiga drives and Mac
drives supporting a different number of drive speeds, so full
Mac&amp;nbsp;compatibility&amp;nbsp;on the Amiga's drives was directly impossible. &amp;nbsp;Future
versions of AMAX that used an internal card on the Amiga 2000 worked
around this issue. &amp;nbsp;It was possible to make a floppy that supported just
the sectors/speeds that were the same on both, but they only stored 272k
of content. &amp;nbsp;But I digress...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other function of the cartridge was that you needed to plug in Mac
roms into it, which the software would read in as it starts. &amp;nbsp;Rather
than storing the ROM on the Amiga, this protected the copyrights or
whatever. &amp;nbsp;But the important thing here is the function. &amp;nbsp;I had picked
up a few AMAX cartridges for $2 apiece at the awesome&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.activesurplus.ca/en/"&gt;Active Surplus
on Queen Street in Toronto&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;a bunch
of years back, so I dug one out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7Q7anY45dnM/UJyUgpiEVAI/AAAAAAAAB7M/U3p_sw6izzM/s1600/2012-11-08+22.59.34.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7Q7anY45dnM/UJyUgpiEVAI/AAAAAAAAB7M/U3p_sw6izzM/s640/2012-11-08+22.59.34.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 401px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Left-to-Right, you see: Amiga D23 floppy connector, for connecting it to
your Amiga, two 28 pin rom sockets, two 74LS393s, one 74LS165, a
resistor, some diodes, a 74LS139, the Mac D19 floppy connector on the
bottom, then the Amiga D23 floppy connector for adding additional Amiga
floppy drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-18w4vJIID1g/UJyU1jLxhdI/AAAAAAAAB7c/kg4tRl3TVUk/s1600/2012-11-08+23.53.05.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-18w4vJIID1g/UJyU1jLxhdI/AAAAAAAAB7c/kg4tRl3TVUk/s640/2012-11-08+23.53.05.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 476px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've started to trace out the circuit, but it became obvious quickly
that it was optimized for board layout rather than what I would consider
to be a sane arrangements of data lines. &amp;nbsp;For example the 8 data output
lines of the ROMs go into the 74LS165 PISO shift register out of order,
so they need to be reshuffled once captured in the host computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead I decided to desolder the chips! &amp;nbsp;My guess at the original
function is something like: the Amiga issues a clear to the 74LS393
binary counter chips, ganged together to yeield a 16 bit output, rather
than two dual-4 bit outputs. &amp;nbsp;This will reset their 16 bit output value
to 0. &amp;nbsp;The 74LS165 parallel-in, serial-out register then latches the 8
bit output from the ROM, and provides it through shifting to the Amiga
via the floppy port. &amp;nbsp;From there, you need to simply pulse the clock on
the '393, and it will&amp;nbsp;increment&amp;nbsp;through every address. Then you just
latch and shift in the data. There's also a 74LS139 demultiplexer, which
might be responsible for sequencing through those events, or perhaps
something to do with the Mac floppy drive. I had a slight mishap and
lost the 74LS165, which is okay since I didn't need it for this project
anyway. &amp;nbsp;Regardless, $2 plus some time -- I'm already ahead and I
haven't even removed the D23s yet (which are the same size as Amiga RGB
Video connectors! Perfect for another project...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yKqJsMVndpk/UJyU-0ld6vI/AAAAAAAAB7k/ytWr1Yz9T1A/s1600/2012-11-08+23.54.08.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image4" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yKqJsMVndpk/UJyU-0ld6vI/AAAAAAAAB7k/ytWr1Yz9T1A/s640/2012-11-08+23.54.08.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 476px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For fun, here's the board with no components on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yPhGkww2fo0/UJx-TvHFDFI/AAAAAAAAB64/ZW5j5cNhgYY/s1600/2012-11-08+21.56.26.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image5" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yPhGkww2fo0/UJx-TvHFDFI/AAAAAAAAB64/ZW5j5cNhgYY/s320/2012-11-08+21.56.26.jpg" style="width: 320px; height: 210px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a slight change in gears I can adapt my design to use the
parts I now have in my toolbox thanks to my desoldering tools. &amp;nbsp;Instead
of the Arduino shifting out an address, it will instead do the process
described above. &amp;nbsp;It will first clear the 393s, then alternately cycle
between clocking out a pulse to increment their values, and reading in
the value directly. Since I'm accessing the ROM data from start to
finish, sequentially anyway, this solution works out perfectly. &amp;nbsp;I also
show four LEDs in the above diagram. Three for various status, one for
UV illumination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cWIzW2S6maY/UKPpxw8t2JI/AAAAAAAAB9I/0FMuEhfRqEg/s1600/2012-11-13+22.30.40.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image6" class="aligncenter" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cWIzW2S6maY/UKPpxw8t2JI/AAAAAAAAB9I/0FMuEhfRqEg/s640/2012-11-13+22.30.40.png" style="width: 426px; height: 640px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a close up of a 27C128 part. This one has Pac-Man programmed
onto it... of course. &amp;nbsp;You can see through the quartz window, and down
onto the EPROM silicon itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Nkxzmx4wLjA/UKRyi43rfVI/AAAAAAAAB9g/KBX-JvT5krk/s1600/2012-11-14+23.16.29.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image7" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Nkxzmx4wLjA/UKRyi43rfVI/AAAAAAAAB9g/KBX-JvT5krk/s400/2012-11-14+23.16.29.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 268px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we see the pins on the Arduino, and how the connect to the shield's
bus connections, along with the LEDs. &amp;nbsp;I could draw this up in a
computerey drawing program, but sketching it out in Sharpie on graph
paper is just&amp;nbsp;quicker... and more Mimsian. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-A1qXIZxizuU/UKRyoHy1G0I/AAAAAAAAB9o/y9jV7rs69_0/s1600/2012-11-14+23.16.36.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image8" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-A1qXIZxizuU/UKRyoHy1G0I/AAAAAAAAB9o/y9jV7rs69_0/s400/2012-11-14+23.16.36.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 247px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the &amp;nbsp;two 74LS393's. &amp;nbsp; You can see their connection to the
address lines on the ROM, as well as the cascading of the counter, e.g.
from 1QD to 2A, and from 2QD to 1A on the second chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ouX_QPqw_mU/UKRyskKJwEI/AAAAAAAAB9w/LgIR8UIhkcc/s1600/2012-11-14+23.16.44.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image9" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ouX_QPqw_mU/UKRyskKJwEI/AAAAAAAAB9w/LgIR8UIhkcc/s400/2012-11-14+23.16.44.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 250px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the wiring for the 28 pin socket, including the 3 pin (two-way)
jumper so that i can use smaller 24 pin parts as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the UV illumination... &amp;nbsp;The data sheets for the EPROMs show that
they should be erased with 253.7 nanometer light, at 15-20 minutes,
2.5cm distance at 15 Watt/seconds per cm^2. &amp;nbsp;I dont know how to measure
this with respect to LEDs, but I'm going to just wing it and see what
happens. &amp;nbsp;The sheet also says that 253.7nm is the optimal wavelength for
erasing them, but anything below 400nm should work. &amp;nbsp;I believe the UV
LEDs I have are somewhere between 350nm and 400nm, so it should work.
&amp;nbsp;The other issue is that the LEDs are substantially less powerful,
probably a tenth to a hundredth the power. We'll see once we get this
going, but I expect it will take on the order of weeks to erase a rom,
rather than minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good thing about this project, in comparison to using EPROMs
functionally, is that you want speed of erasure for functional use. &amp;nbsp;I
personally found that my eraser worked on most of the devices I own in
about 10 minutes. &amp;nbsp;I would often have a chip or two in the eraser, while
programming and debugging others. &amp;nbsp;It worked out fairly well. &amp;nbsp;For this
project, it's&amp;nbsp;completely&amp;nbsp;okay if it takes on the order of hours to erase
a device. &amp;nbsp;I'll find out how well it works once I get it going. &amp;nbsp;I may
use more than one LED just to speed it up a little, in case it takes on
the order of days instead of minutes or hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7pdS0XmtszQ/UKPeqW1OBtI/AAAAAAAAB8Q/s9vl4QBZE_U/s1600/2012-11-10+00.56.30.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image10" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7pdS0XmtszQ/UKPeqW1OBtI/AAAAAAAAB8Q/s9vl4QBZE_U/s400/2012-11-10+00.56.30.jpg" style="width: 298px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

foundation to build this upon. &amp;nbsp;I wanted to leave space for possibly
using larger chips in the future, so what is the bottom of the board
here has space for a few extra data lines if i re-route that red power
line. &amp;nbsp;The '393's are layed out so that the one on the right, which
addresses bits A0-A7 has four of its lines directly lined up. &amp;nbsp;This was
to try to make it a little easier to wire up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought some wire wrap wire for address, data, and
control lines, and did most of the work of wiring those up&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/"&gt;one
evening at Interlock&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I used red for
control (counter clear, clock data cascade lines) as well as eprom
address lines. &amp;nbsp;I used blue for data lines. &amp;nbsp;In the above pictures you
can see how the wires were routed around (there was some more writing on
the bottom, obviously.) You can also see how the UV LEDs are mounted
with some stiff solid core wire. &amp;nbsp;I reduced the number of LEDs to two
plus the UV LEDs for no real reason at all. &amp;nbsp;(There is an Arduino
underneath there somewhere...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the two images above, you can see a jumper on the left of the first
image, bottom of the second image... this changes what one pin is used
for. &amp;nbsp;For smaller EPROMs, pin 26 of the 28 pin footprint is used for
VCC, powering the chip. &amp;nbsp;In the larger packages, VCC is moved to pin 28,
and pin 26 is used for Address line 13. &amp;nbsp;It's confusing. &amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ah_ZDi13ZcngdFlfcDJHWERpNUVGMlBYR0dvdE1kdnc"&gt;A table that
shows all of the
pinouts&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;doesn't
really help too much, but it was necessary so that I could figure things
out for wiring it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YTbYoRlJDnQ/UKPfF034T1I/AAAAAAAAB8s/NsEVhDXgH9M/s1600/2012-11-14+02.17.32.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image13" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YTbYoRlJDnQ/UKPfF034T1I/AAAAAAAAB8s/NsEVhDXgH9M/s400/2012-11-14+02.17.32.png" style="width: 400px; height: 340px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next is firmware. I wrote a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.umlautllama.com/rand/ROM-Project-Arduino.txt"&gt;pretty simple program for the
Arduino&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that
simply enables the EPROM, resets the counters, then clocks through the
addresses, reads them in and sends that data down through the serial
link. &amp;nbsp;After getting the enable lines wrong (active low, rather than
active high), I managed to get it spitting out actual accurate ROM
contents. &amp;nbsp;As you can see in the above, it read out of the ROM (right
half) 0xf3, 0x3e, 0x00, and so on. &amp;nbsp;In a disassembly of Ms PacMan on the
left, you can see these bytes in cyan, just to the right of the red
numbers 0000, 0001, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other half is a simple program that runs on a host computer that
simply reads in serial data and logs it out to a file. &amp;nbsp;That content
looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've now had this running for 12 hours with no change in the bits at
all. &amp;nbsp;I'm thinking that it will require running for upwards of a week or
two to have any affect on bits. &amp;nbsp;I may need to just drop the Arduino and
ROM shield into my eraser to get the results I'm looking for... or at
least a &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; to prove that the idea has a chance of working from
here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If nothing else, I now have a way to read EPROMS from an Arduino.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XJGRCMuyj2o/UJoNvgJQuRI/AAAAAAAAB5s/NPDbRYe7WqE/s1600/2012-11-07+02.07.52.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XJGRCMuyj2o/UJoNvgJQuRI/AAAAAAAAB5s/NPDbRYe7WqE/s640/2012-11-07+02.07.52.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 475px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time now, I've had some ideas that center around EPROMs.
&amp;nbsp;I've been using EPROMS since I started getting into arcade machine
collecting. &amp;nbsp;EPROMs are programmable devices where you can store bytes
of memory in a fairly stable method. &amp;nbsp;They look like any other
microchip, except that they have a transparent window on the top
(usually quartz, even though it looks like glass). &amp;nbsp;If you look in the
window, you can see the chip die in there, which I usually think looks
like a tiny tennis court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above image shows a few different size. &amp;nbsp;The one on the right is a
2716, 16 kilobit (2 kilobyte) device. &amp;nbsp;The one in the middle is a
27C256, 256 kilobit (32 kilobyte) device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-I98O53ShKxo/UJoNZzepHdI/AAAAAAAAB5c/aEIHuJ1Qt6A/s1600/2012-11-07+02.02.53.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-I98O53ShKxo/UJoNZzepHdI/AAAAAAAAB5c/aEIHuJ1Qt6A/s320/2012-11-07+02.02.53.jpg" style="width: 235px; height: 320px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;To use an EPROM, you place it in an eraser, which is usually a
ultraviolet light (often a fluorescent, non-filtered black light tube)
with a timer, for about 10-12 minutes or so. &amp;nbsp;This sets all of the bits
in the device to 1's. &amp;nbsp;(0xff hex).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1kK5sgB9PnU/UJoNkK2lUHI/AAAAAAAAB5k/5D_oMNYxpl4/s1600/2012-11-07+02.04.28.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1kK5sgB9PnU/UJoNkK2lUHI/AAAAAAAAB5k/5D_oMNYxpl4/s400/2012-11-07+02.04.28.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 296px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you take the chip, and plug it into a programmer. &amp;nbsp;A computer tells
the programmer what zeroes to write and where, and you end up with a
chip that has a program or some data stored in it, so that it can be
read out later. &amp;nbsp;Often, the window is then covered up so that they are
not accidentally erased over time from ambient UV light. One data sheet
I read said that 1 week in direct sunlight, or 3 years in normal office
lighting will erase a device. &amp;nbsp;The programmer above is my Needham's
EMP-10. &amp;nbsp;It has a 30 pin simm-looking slot on the side with 3 snap-in
cards that configure the programmer pins so that it can handle a variety
of different target device EPROMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process has fascinated me since I started burning ROMs for use in
arcade machines. &amp;nbsp;This is where this project comes in.&amp;nbsp;I've had a few
thoughts about things to explore here...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, it should be possible to determine which bytes are in
which physical locations on the device by casting a shadow or projecting
an image onto the die from the eraser. &amp;nbsp;It should be possible to
determine this by projecting different patterns on the die with the UV
erasing light. &amp;nbsp;Obviously, it has to be well focused; this has to be
quite precise. &amp;nbsp;A project for another day...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I thought a fun project might be to read the pattern produced
by erasing the device. &amp;nbsp;I would program all zeroes to the EPROM. &amp;nbsp;The
chip would be plugged into an Arduino, to read the data out of it. &amp;nbsp;The
Arduino would also control a UV LED or two which would illuminate the
window on the EPROM, erasing it. &amp;nbsp;It would then alternate between
illuminating the window and reading the content out of it. &amp;nbsp;The data
pulled out would then be displayed as an image with pixels white if the
content is a '1', and black if it is a '0'. &amp;nbsp;This should show all white
at the start, and all black at the end, with some amount of dithering in
the middle somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bLHjaeRhyTs/UJoNH7rnlMI/AAAAAAAAB5I/UdksQ0NSy0U/s1600/2012-11-07+01.58.52.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bLHjaeRhyTs/UJoNH7rnlMI/AAAAAAAAB5I/UdksQ0NSy0U/s320/2012-11-07+01.58.52.jpg" style="width: 320px; height: 320px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a bunch of chips pulled from various electronic gadgets over the
years, and the most prevalent of them was this 2732. &amp;nbsp;It has a nice
small package, small data size (4 kilobytes), so downloading the content
from it should be fairly quick... and I have a whole lot of them, so if
a few get destroyed in the process, it's no big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EHaidC5ynzI/UJqCpZJViSI/AAAAAAAAB6Q/hsr864Oeovc/s1600/2012-11-07+12.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image4" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EHaidC5ynzI/UJqCpZJViSI/AAAAAAAAB6Q/hsr864Oeovc/s400/2012-11-07+12.JPG" style="width: 400px; height: 338px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I considered hooking this EPROM up directly to the Arduino, but
I need 24 lines to control it. &amp;nbsp;16 for address to the chip, 8 for data
from the chip. &amp;nbsp;Not to mention a line to drive the LED. &amp;nbsp;I could go with
an Arduino Mega, or Due, but I do not own either. &amp;nbsp;I only really needed
12 of those 16 address lines, which would bring it to 20 IO needed,
which is still more than was available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--ywYLtULcPk/UJqCoRfi1xI/AAAAAAAAB6E/PmrjTU_-fxE/s1600/2012-11-07+11.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image5" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--ywYLtULcPk/UJqCoRfi1xI/AAAAAAAAB6E/PmrjTU_-fxE/s400/2012-11-07+11.JPG" style="width: 400px; height: 291px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have a spare&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mayhewlabs.com/products/arduino-mux-shield"&gt;Mayhew Labs Mux
Shield&lt;/a&gt;, (mine is
a previous version) so I decided to just run with that. &amp;nbsp;Unfortunately
this is where the story goes south. &amp;nbsp;I went from idea to making the
board in one day. I really should have spent more time thinking about
it, and less time being impulsive and just creating the thing. &amp;nbsp;I was
too excited, incorrectly thinking that I had what I needed for the
project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should note that I often enjoy when a project fails. &amp;nbsp;It really helps
me learn what I did wrong, why it didn't work, and then it's like a
puzzle to figure out how to make it work. &amp;nbsp;Sometimes, things just get
frustrating and I will shelve a project indefinitely, but often I figure
things out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wired up a socket, cobbled together from smaller DIP sockets, onto a
piece of strip board. &amp;nbsp;I also threw a few indicator LEDs onto the board
for various runtime display. After an evening of work, I came up with
the board as seen here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vcDaSPXWoTg/UJoM13i_plI/AAAAAAAAB44/74-H3Fn2ZvA/s1600/2012-11-06+22.50.45.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image6" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vcDaSPXWoTg/UJoM13i_plI/AAAAAAAAB44/74-H3Fn2ZvA/s400/2012-11-06+22.50.45.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 296px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-loed2kQYnbY/UJoNDHYXfRI/AAAAAAAAB5A/-sgcl3ynaKI/s1600/2012-11-06+22.50.58.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image7" class="aligncenter" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-loed2kQYnbY/UJoNDHYXfRI/AAAAAAAAB5A/-sgcl3ynaKI/s400/2012-11-06+22.50.58.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 296px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was wired on the circuit side of the board (I do not recommend this)
because then I could easily plug it in to the Mux Shield using the pin
connectors I had. &amp;nbsp;The three red LEDs are wired to a few unused port
pins on the mux, and the frosted LED on the right is an amber LED which
I scuffed the top of to make it glow more than illuminate. &amp;nbsp;I have yet
to power this up, because it was at this point, when I was done building
it that I realized the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mux Shield is an excellent device. I use it for my Jasper Box to
read inputs. &amp;nbsp;For inputs, it's awesome. &amp;nbsp;It'll do 48 IO, even analog
input. &amp;nbsp;For output, that's where it gets a bit&amp;nbsp;non-intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chips used on it are unbuffered. &amp;nbsp;That is to say that there's no way
to specifically sample or store data out or in on it. &amp;nbsp;You pick a line,
and then immediately read or write from it. &amp;nbsp;Think of it as a valve, not
a view. &amp;nbsp;This is to say that at any one point in time, you're only
setting or reading one bit. &amp;nbsp;When reading the EPROM, I want to specify a
single address (16 bits of digital output) then read in the data from
the chip (8 bits of digital input). &amp;nbsp;I can only do one bit at a time, so
it is impossible to set the 16 bits simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for this to work, I need to add a latch of some kind to the
circuit to store the 16 bit address, so that I can then read in the 8
bits of data for that address in the EPROM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FDgWE5um2xI/UJqCnxDW4YI/AAAAAAAAB6A/b3ycReA1ZTY/s1600/2012-11-07+10.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image8" class="aligncenter" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FDgWE5um2xI/UJqCnxDW4YI/AAAAAAAAB6A/b3ycReA1ZTY/s400/2012-11-07+10.JPG" style="width: 327px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a sketch for the next version of this project. &amp;nbsp;As you can see,
instead of using the Mux Shield, I'm now using a pair of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/733"&gt;74HC595
serial-in, parallel-out shift
registers&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;chained together.
&amp;nbsp;The idea here is that I would shift in the address I want to read
through both of the '595s, then latch in the data on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9519"&gt;74HC165
parallel-in, serial-out shift
register&lt;/a&gt;. This is actually
taking it one step too far, since the '165 is unnecessary. &amp;nbsp;The thing on
the left is the UV LED and its resistor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ptkXdzVAcIg/UJqOvYeUR5I/AAAAAAAAB6k/R7b3MIyQJVA/s1600/2012-11-07+11.35.20.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image9" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ptkXdzVAcIg/UJqOvYeUR5I/AAAAAAAAB6k/R7b3MIyQJVA/s400/2012-11-07+11.35.20.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 387px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here's a simplifed version where the data lines of the EPROM are
hooked directly into the Arduino. &amp;nbsp;It also shows three indicator LEDs on
the top, which will be used to show the state of the device at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to order some parts to build this, and once I get them, I will be
posting further results on the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Amiga 1000 computer (1985) with an Amiga 3000 &amp;quot;pregnant&amp;quot; mouse.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the fun things about owning retro computers is that you get to
repair them yourself. (Perhaps this isn't a fun thing for some of you,
but I really enjoy it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 6 years ago, my Amiga 1000 started showing some strange behaviors
but only in the green levels of the video. &amp;nbsp;If you dragged the green
slider, instead of it stepping up gradually from dark to bright, it
would get brighter, darker, brighter, darker, much brighter, a little
darker than that, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 5 years ago, I had opened it up and replaced two '244 latches in
the video output section. &amp;nbsp;I kinda did this blindly by looking at the
schematic...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col width="100%" /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Video output circuit on the A1000 --&amp;nbsp;Left to right:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;Denise coprocessor,&amp;nbsp;'244 latches, resistor ladders, and output
transistors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...and replacing the two latches, assuming that one of them had gone
bad. &amp;nbsp;After doing the repair, the problem persisted and I just gave up
on it for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col width="100%" /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Green section is at the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;The two '244 latches are now socketed and replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, a comment on the above video re-sparked interest in this
project and I decided to bring the Amiga over
to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/"&gt;Interlock&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and really get to the
bottom of the problem. I hooked it up to a scope and followed the paths
according to the schematics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col width="100%" /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BGRmTKCir9A/UH7Dk_Ln6tI/AAAAAAAABs0/CZfwXU_-m0E/s1600/IMG_0549.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BGRmTKCir9A/UH7Dk_Ln6tI/AAAAAAAABs0/CZfwXU_-m0E/s640/IMG_0549.JPG" style="width: 640px; height: 476px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Amiga 1000 apart, hooked up to a scope and a LCD monitor.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video circuit is on the left edge of the board, just under the power
cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I traced the lines from input on Q2 (where all of the four resistors in
the D-to-A resistor ladder are joined, and back through to the latch,
and then continuing back to the Denise video generation coprocessor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Z9jwp8H9SmI/UH7Dj99trmI/AAAAAAAABss/JmJd8sqc1C0/s1600/IMG_0548.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image4" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Z9jwp8H9SmI/UH7Dj99trmI/AAAAAAAABss/JmJd8sqc1C0/s400/IMG_0548.JPG" style="width: 400px; height: 298px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried jumpering across various portions of the resistor ladder to try
to track down exactly where the issue was. &amp;nbsp;It gave some pretty
interesting results, but really only helped me track down where the
issue is.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I eventually came to the realization that something on the
R55 data path was drawing it down to ground, or at least close to
ground. (Where the left alligator clip is attached in the above
picture.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table border="1" class="docutils"&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;The &amp;quot;Green&amp;quot; section of the video generation circuit in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;the Amiga 1000 with notes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried pulling out the pins on the Denise's G1 output (pin 29) and
soldering it directly to pin 15 of U6A, and it didn't change anything.
&amp;nbsp;I then pretty much realized that the issue was on the other side of U6A
-- the connection between pin 5 of U6A and the left side of R55 (4k
resistor). &amp;nbsp;I decided to leave the above wire &amp;quot;flying&amp;quot; and pulled the
resistor leg, soldering it directly to pin 5 of U6A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-a3ejuzXFvlE/UH7Dm8-OTcI/AAAAAAAABtE/vTafHBGflXY/s1600/IMG_0565.PNG"&gt;&lt;img alt="image6" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-a3ejuzXFvlE/UH7Dm8-OTcI/AAAAAAAABtE/vTafHBGflXY/s640/IMG_0565.PNG" style="width: 640px; height: 426px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This did the trick! &amp;nbsp;It worked. &amp;nbsp;I probably could have restored the
flying wire back to the original traces on the board, desoldering the
wire, re-seating the chips, but I had flexed those pins in and out a
lot, and decided to not stress out the pins anymore, and just leave it.
&amp;nbsp;-- &amp;quot;It works... don't touch it!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 5 years of it sitting on a shelf, my trusty 'ol Amiga, my favorite
computer, is finally is working again!&lt;/p&gt;

take the sort of ethics of the classic computer systems from the 1970s,
which by design were considered what we now woud call &amp;quot;homebrew&amp;quot; and
apply them to modern computing. I tried to keep things as stock and
off-the-shelf as possible, so that this was easily reproducible by
others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, building a standard x86 PC from boards is not really in the same
neighborhood of what I wanted to do here. &amp;nbsp;I want to do something with
the feel of the Apple I for example. &amp;nbsp;Buying components, making wiring
harnesses, writing firmware to control it, and having the primary user
interface for it be a BASIC environment, much like the home computers of
the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name &amp;quot;BL-328&amp;quot; is taken in the same way that the TRS-80 got its name
(&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;andy/&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;adio &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;hack Z&lt;strong&gt;80&lt;/strong&gt; based computer.) For
this, I went with &amp;quot;BL&amp;quot; signifying &amp;quot;BleuLlama&amp;quot;, the nickname I use for
IRC, and &amp;quot;328&amp;quot; signifying the ATMega 328 AVR microcontroller in the form
of an &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://arduino.cc"&gt;Arduino&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should note that&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://benheck.com/"&gt;Ben Heckendorn&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;recently
did a similar project, which you can &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.element14.com/community/docs/DOC-49215/l/episode-49-see-ben-hecks-pocket-computer-episode"&gt;watch his project on The Ben Heck
Show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To follow along with this first step, all you will need for the first
step is an Arduino board, available from
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://adafruit.com/category/17"&gt;Adafruit&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/103"&gt;Sparkfun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.radioshack.com/search/index.jsp?kwCatId=&amp;amp;kw=arduino&amp;amp;origkw=arduino&amp;amp;sr=1"&gt;Radio

homemade, etc. &amp;nbsp; The one I'm using is one I bought a few years ago from
Sparkfun, the Arduino Pro.&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/10/2012-09-30-14.38.02.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1009" src="/wp-uploads/2012/10/2012-09-30-14.38.02-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one has the pin header on the right side there which connects to an
FTDI cable to a host computer. &amp;nbsp;I will also be using this connector to
power the entire system through the use of the FTDI-USB cable, AA
Battery holder, or rechargable battery pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start off, I took &amp;quot;TinyBasic&amp;quot; which had been ported for use on the
Arduino by Michael Field, and I have&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/BleuLlama/TinyBasicPlus"&gt;since expanded
upon&lt;/a&gt;(github project
link). &amp;nbsp;I have added SD card support with loading and saving, data pin
IO, as well as graphic functions specific to this project, but I'm
getting ahead of myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downloading that project's TinyBasicPlus.ino to the Arduino will give
you a Basic interface with few hundred bytes of program space free. &amp;nbsp;You
can use the &amp;quot;Serial Monitor&amp;quot; which is bundled with the Arduino IDE to
interact with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arduino has 13 digital IO pins, some of which can be used for
pseudo-analog output through the use of
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation"&gt;PWM&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;nbsp;as well
as 6 analog Input pins,&amp;nbsp;which&amp;nbsp;can also be used for Digital IO. &amp;nbsp;A simple
program to print out 10 results from Analog input 3, and turn on digital
output 5 is as follows: (Note, that this assumes a new feature of
TinyBasicPlus, &amp;quot;autoconfigure&amp;quot; is enabled)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
10 REM example program
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
20 DWRITE 5, HIGH
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
30 FOR A = 0 TO 10
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
40 b = AREAD 3
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
50 PRINT B
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
60 NEXT A
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can write programs that will read port pins, write to port pins, and
then load and save to an SD card, if you have FileIO enabled. &amp;nbsp;The SD
interface I went with from this was the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/sd-card-shield-p-492.html?cPath=109"&gt;SeeedStudio SD Card
Shield&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;which
was&amp;nbsp;reasonably&amp;nbsp;priced at Radio Shack. &amp;nbsp;It is hard-configured for its
&amp;quot;select&amp;quot; to be on pin 10, which is shown in the TinyBasicPlus.ino file.
&amp;nbsp;You will need to comment out the #undef for fileio and SD card support,
and remove the comment for the related #define. &amp;nbsp;In its current state,
it uses the SD library included with the Arduino package, this uses 9k
bytes of program space, which is a lot. &amp;nbsp;I need to find a smaller SD
library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/10/2012-09-30-14.38.15.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1010" src="/wp-uploads/2012/10/2012-09-30-14.38.15-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that this is enabled, the above program could be saved out to the SD
card like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
SAVE example1.bas
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then re-loaded later like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
LOAD example1.bas
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, a feature was added to TinyBasicPlus that lets programs be
autoloaded when you power on. &amp;nbsp;This is especially useful if you want to
write your program (or programs) in BASIC on the device itself, rather
than through the Arduino IDE in C. &amp;nbsp;This is accomplished by enabling the
AUTORUN feature in TinyBasicPlus.ino, and by saving your startup program
as &amp;quot;autorun.bas&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can go a step further and have the end of your program &amp;quot;CHAIN&amp;quot; to
another program. &amp;nbsp;That is to say, you could have it load and run another
program. eg:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the file &amp;quot;autorun.bas&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
10 PRINT &amp;quot;Hello&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
20 CHAIN &amp;quot;two.bas&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the file &amp;quot;two.bas&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
10 PRINT &amp;quot;World!&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
20 CHAIN &amp;quot;autorun.bas&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will start up, run the &amp;quot;autorun.bas&amp;quot;, which will then load the
&amp;quot;two.bas&amp;quot; program, which will chain to the &amp;quot;autorun.bas&amp;quot; program,
forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough with the software though. &amp;nbsp;I'll now get into a bit of the
hardware, namely the power system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, there are a few ways we can power the system.
&amp;nbsp;Currently, since the only interaction you have with it is through the
serial port/FTDI interface, you'll have it powered through that, but
once we bring this thing into a standalone configuration, we'll want
battery power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first power pack is a 4AA battery pack with a switch that I picked
up from Adafruit. This has the power lines wired to a 6-pin interface
like the FTDI interface has. &amp;nbsp;This lets me use standard AA batteries
(rechargable or not) to power the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/10/2012-09-30-14.39.24.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1013" src="/wp-uploads/2012/10/2012-09-30-14.39.24-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up is a USB-based rechargable battery I picked up at the local
supermarket for $20. &amp;nbsp;It's a rechargable (Lithium Ion, perhaps?) battery
with Mini USB input for charging, then standard USB for output. &amp;nbsp;I could
use the FTDI cable off of this, but instead, I decided to make a tiny
adapter so that I can plug it directly in through the same 6 pin
interface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/10/2012-09-30-14.38.45.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1011" src="/wp-uploads/2012/10/2012-09-30-14.38.45-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea how long either of these will power the system for. &amp;nbsp;I'm
guessing a substantial number of hours. &amp;nbsp;I've also since made a cable
that connects between the battery pack and that header, rather than that
little widget pictured above, which is essentially a USB cord whose
power lines are wired directly to the FTDI connector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the above, you can &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ladyada.net/learn/arduino/lesson3.html"&gt;hook up an LED to digital pin
5&lt;/a&gt;, and do a
version of the &amp;quot;Blink&amp;quot; program included with Arduino:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the file &amp;quot;autorun.bas&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
10 REM Basic Blinker
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
20 DWRITE 5, HIGH
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
30 DELAY 500
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
40 DWRITE 5, LOW
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
50 DELAY 500
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
60 GOTO 30
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, disconnect the FTDI cable, hook up the battery, and it should
blink the LED forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it for this time. &amp;nbsp;Soon, we'll convert an old Commodore 64
keyboard into an input device for the computer, add LCD modules for
output, and other goodies so that we'll be able to go standalone and not
need a host computer at all!&lt;/p&gt;

Luxeon LEDs. &amp;nbsp;My original thought was that I would rebuild an lightshow
device that I had built many years ago, but instead of it driving 110V
spot lights through solid state relays, it would instead be more
self-contained, and use high power LEDs instead. &amp;nbsp;This project never
happened, since I never figured out how to power the LEDs properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've recently been getting into doing more little projects, especially
since I want to have &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; to do on Tuesday nights at Interlock.
&amp;nbsp;I saw the box of these things on the shelf, and decided to try driving
them directly from an Arduino. &amp;nbsp; I know that I could have used one of
the BlinkM modules, or the strand of RGB Pixels or whatever for this,
but I had these, and I wanted to see what I could do / how bright I
could make them without frying the Arduino.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/09/2012-09-26-09.10.10-e1348677126508.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-994" src="/wp-uploads/2012/09/2012-09-26-09.10.10-e1348677126508-300x271.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 271px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project I decided to work on with them is to make a single
high-brightness RGB pixel, and drive it from a Processing sketch on my
computer. &amp;nbsp;Eventually, the thought might be to sample a TV's color,
30fps for a few hours, then just store those brightness/color levels.
&amp;nbsp;Then, play them back on the pixel to light a room. &amp;nbsp;From outside of the
room, it &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; look like a television is on, showing some kind of TV
show. &amp;nbsp;The way I went with testing this was to take a movie trailer, and
crunch it down to a few pixels, and then average the colors in it while
it plays back, live via Processing, then send the RGB values over
USB-Serial to be displayed on the pixel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/09/2012-09-26-09.13.51.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-997" src="/wp-uploads/2012/09/2012-09-26-09.13.51-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started out by soldering up a Red, Green, and Blue LED to a small
piece of perf board. &amp;nbsp;I tied them together for a common ground on one
side, and through a 220 ohm resistor on the other side, and all of this
out to the Arduino. &amp;nbsp;I use PWM pins on the Arduino to adjust their
brightness, since that's simple to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/09/2012-09-26-09.11.51.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-995" src="/wp-uploads/2012/09/2012-09-26-09.11.51-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Processing sketch sends down 0..255 for red, green, and blue
intensities, then those values are plugged directly into the PWM pins
via AnalogWrite() calls, which displays a reasonable facsimile of the
color requested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/09/2012-09-26-09.12.31.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-996" src="/wp-uploads/2012/09/2012-09-26-09.12.31-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project worked out pretty darn well. &amp;nbsp;Without current drivers for
the LEDs, I can't make them too bright, but in an hour of sitting down
at Interlock, I had this working. &amp;nbsp;I wrote up two processing sketches.
&amp;nbsp;One with a RGB color wheel - click to send that color to the LEDs, and
another playing the video as described above. &amp;nbsp;(Arduino and Processing
sketches available upon request. :D )&lt;/p&gt;

how this silly little RF remote communicates to its home base. The
remote controls a music playing device and since it's RF, the project
required me to learn about radio frequencies and some hardware hacking.
I've been asking Interlock members for help and they've given me ideas
along the way. JustBill, one of our radio hackers, has jumped on the
project and started analyzing the remote from the RF perspective.
Berticus and Robo Alex have also donated their brains for the hardware
hacking portion. Our goal was to learn how the remote works so that we
can make our own remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="rf-rc"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;RF RC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This radio frequency remote control (RF RC)&amp;nbsp;controls &amp;nbsp;a device that
plays music. For the purpose of this post, that's all we need to care
about it. Our first step was to do recon on the hardware so we
researched the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://transition.fcc.gov/oet/ea/fccid/"&gt;FCC
documents&lt;/a&gt;. Taking it apart
we learn that there are two boards we want to worry about. The remote
board that has an integrated circuit (IC) to handle button presses, and
a radio daughter board that takes input and converts it to a a radio
signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/07/DSC_8657.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" class="size-medium wp-image-969 alignnone" src="/wp-uploads/2012/07/DSC_8657-300x198.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 198px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/07/DSC_8664.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="alignnone" src="/wp-uploads/2012/07/DSC_8664-198x300.jpg" style="width: 198px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;`&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&amp;lt;/wp-uploads/2012/07/DSC_8664.jpg&amp;gt;`__&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ir-ic"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IR IC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After taking apart the remote, we look at the lower portion to find an
IC made by Hynix. Thankfully,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.skhynix.com/en/index.jsp"&gt;Hynix&lt;/a&gt; still sells a similar
chip that's designed for infra-red (IR) and was nice enough to give the
pin outs in the data sheet that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/07/hynix_circuit.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-973" src="/wp-uploads/2012/07/hynix_circuit-300x192.png" style="width: 300px; height: 192px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tells us most of what we want to know to see what happens during a
button press. We verify this with a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.saleae.com/logic/"&gt;Salae Logic
Analyzer&lt;/a&gt; that I love a lot, and we can
make this block diagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/07/HYNIX_chiplayout.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-964" src="/wp-uploads/2012/07/HYNIX_chiplayout-246x300.png" style="width: 246px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logic analyzer also gave us a good quality sample of what the signal
looks like before it is sent to the RF daughter board. In the diagram
above, if you look at the thicker line, this represents the
communication going from the Hynix chip, to the RF daughter board. And
that signal looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/07/logic_comparison_IR_DECODE-e1342714104358.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image4" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-975" src="/wp-uploads/2012/07/logic_comparison_IR_DECODE-e1342714104358-300x40.png" style="width: 300px; height: 40px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's interesting about this is if you look at it closely, it's has 32
transitions from digital HIGH to digital LOW during a single
transmission. If you split them up into bytes, we now see 4 groups of
data being transmitted. The first group is the sync to tell the device
to listen and is always &amp;quot;0 1011101.&amp;quot; The second is a PIN that can be set
to make sure the remote only talks to this device and not other ones.
Basically, this is a passcode that can be anywhere from 000 to 255. The
third group is the button ID. This tells which button is being pressed.
The last group is a verification of the button ID which is done by doing
a bit flip of the previous binary. &amp;quot;00000001&amp;quot; turns into &amp;quot;11111110.&amp;quot; So
I created a map of the useful button IDs for later: Power is decimal 30,
volume up is 79, pause is 76, and mysterious &amp;quot;P1&amp;quot; is 14. So if we wanted
to transmit a power button with a pin code of &amp;quot;000&amp;quot; it would look like
this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;01011101 00000000 01111000 10000111&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="rf-rf"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;RF RF&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons this project became fun was because the radio doesn't
transmit on IR. It's RF only. This means that all the amateur radio
operators at Interlock could come to my rescue and explain what was
going on. First we needed to find out what carrier frequency it used. It
turns out that we didn't have to look to far because both the carrier
frequency and the modulation type were in the remote's owners manual!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/07/CF_manual.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image5" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-984" src="/wp-uploads/2012/07/CF_manual.png" style="width: 334px; height: 49px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case 433.92MHz FSK are for new versions of this device and
27.145MHz are for older.&amp;nbsp;433.92MHz is in the&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band"&gt;ISM
band&lt;/a&gt; and used by a lot of
small electronics like a garage door opener. Our first goal was to
capture a sample of the RF so that we could analyze the data in some
kind of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform"&gt;FFT&lt;/a&gt;.
This would tell us the data inside of the transmission as well as
confirm which type of encoding it was using.
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-shift_keying"&gt;FSK&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude-shift_keying"&gt;ASK&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-shift_keying"&gt;PSK&lt;/a&gt;, etc)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/07/DSC_8664.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image6" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-972" src="/wp-uploads/2012/07/DSC_8664-198x300.jpg" style="width: 198px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first attempts to use ham radio equipment were a failure. We later
found out that the equipment could listen on 433.92MHz, but the ham
equipment was listening on too narrow of a bandwidth to correctly
capture the entire signal. The company I work for was happy to lend me
their USRP. Yay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've never heard of a
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Software_Radio_Peripheral"&gt;USRP&lt;/a&gt;,
this is what ham guys normally call a software defined radio, or a radio
that can be a range of frequencies depending on what you program it to
be. You can control things like bandwidth and frequency by sending it a
simple command. The USRP was designed by Ettus Labs and sold to National
Instruments and has become a defacto part of the RF hackers' toolkit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this, we were able to get a good sampling of the transmission from
the remote that looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/07/omfg_iv_had_this_the_whole_time-e1342715544473.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image7" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-963" src="/wp-uploads/2012/07/omfg_iv_had_this_the_whole_time-e1342715544473-300x56.png" style="width: 300px; height: 56px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="signal-processing"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Signal Processing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting the RF signal and the data collected from the logic analyzer, we
can now make some conclusions. Namely, that this is an extremely simple
circuit that isn't doing much encoding or modulation when its being
converted to RF. Basically the RF signal that you see above, is the
exact same as the data being sent by the Hynix chip. This will be
important later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="results"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To review we have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reversed the hardware that handles pressing the button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;captured a sample of the RF signal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discovered what data is being transmitted and how&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step was to create my own remote from scratch. I did this using
an Arduino and an RF chip designed to transmit on 433.92MHz. Thanks to
Robo Alex for setting this thing up for me. It turns out I don't need
the ground plane which is that giant piece of copper in the picture, but
it doesn't hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/07/IMG_20120707_150902-e1342717151722.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image8" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-978" src="/wp-uploads/2012/07/IMG_20120707_150902-e1342717151722-300x152.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 152px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What this does right now, is transmit on 433.92MHz, whatever button that
I'd like, supplying whatever PIN code that I'd like. When I capture the
data using the USRP, I find that my Arduino kit transmits perfectly at
433.92MHz while the remote has an offset of about 60 hertz so that it
transmits at 433.98Mhz. That's kind of a deal breaker for me right now
and I'm looking for a replacement IC or something else so that I can
transmit on the correct carrier freq. Until then, enjoy this random
data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/07/usrp.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image9" class="aligncenter" src="/wp-uploads/2012/07/usrp-1024x678.jpg" style="width: 614px; height: 407px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="defcon"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Defcon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to hear more about this (I don't know why you would),

things) at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.defcon.org"&gt;Defcon&lt;/a&gt;'s

current printer, and are on the cusp of another advancement in our
&lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}/quick-open-house-recap.rst"&gt;previously-mentioned 3D printing
capabilities&lt;/a&gt;,
now that 3 people have decided which printer design they're going to
build next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we continue to torture Beardicus's poor little &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://reprappro.com/Huxley"&gt;Huxley
RepRapPro&lt;/a&gt; making other little
tschotskes that speak to our interests. This doesn't get us closer to
the glorious future of 3D printers for everyone, but I like to think of
it as our answer to Wall Street's &amp;quot;profit taking&amp;quot;: Every once in a while
it's nice to just cash out a little bit and enjoy what you've already
got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My turn at that most recently was this little model of monomeric
insulin, based on the crystal structure reported by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1504238"&gt;Gursky et.
al.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick is how to take a computer model of something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="9ins solvent-accessible surface Z rotation" src="http://deejoe.etrumeus.com/interlock/9ins/9ins.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and print it on the 3D printer so that it goes from being an
on-the-screen abstraction to something you can hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider that there are many different ways to render these things on a
screen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/05/montage2.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-928" src="/wp-uploads/2012/05/montage2.png" style="width: 576px; height: 567px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each has its uses. But learning how to manipulate an on-screen rendering
can be a fraught experience. How much better, then, to have the option
of turning the model over directly, with your own hands?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With fused deposition printing, the problem is that the irregular
surface doesn't really present a good way of getting the nascent object
to stick to the print bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start, I trolled through the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rcsb.org"&gt;RCSB&lt;/a&gt; web site
for a suitable small globular protein that had a bit of name
recognition. I picked
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"&gt;insulin&lt;/a&gt;, and from among the
various insulin entries, picked
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=9ins"&gt;9INS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I brought that file up in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pymol.org"&gt;PyMOL&lt;/a&gt;, issued &amp;quot;hide
everything&amp;quot; and then &amp;quot;show surface&amp;quot; (or their GUI equivalents) and, with
a few other visual tweaks, like setting the color, exported a VRML 2
(.wrl) file. I played around with that in meshlab a bit, exporting it
then as an .stl file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally sorted out that what I really needed to do was bring it into
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.blender.org"&gt;Blender&lt;/a&gt; and subtract a cube-shaped (well,
any volume with a flat face would probably do) volume from the molecule
to give a partial rendering of the model with a flat surface. Doing that
twice, to generate each &amp;quot;half&amp;quot; of the molecule, leaves me with two .stl
files that can be printed flat side down. In some cases, I've brought
the file into &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://cloud.netfabb.com"&gt;netfabb's online service&lt;/a&gt;
for cleanup of manifold errors. Then, I bring each file into
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://replicat.org"&gt;ReplicatorG&lt;/a&gt; to more easily scale and orient
the model. Finally, I bring the .stl files into
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://slic3r.org"&gt;Slic3r&lt;/a&gt; to generate the .g file for taking over
to the printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/05/IMG_4786.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-889" src="/wp-uploads/2012/05/IMG_4786-300x225.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 225px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This result is a fairly small protein and a fairly small model that was
fast to design and print as a proof of concept. Future challenges will
be to find ways of dividing up larger models and of larger molecules or
multi-molecule assemblies so they can be printed, perhaps printing
different chains in different colors, preserving relative scaling
between different components and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12283"&gt;There&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:18928"&gt;are&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/05/11.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-907" src="/wp-uploads/2012/05/11-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to go for this one becuase I wanted to have it printed out and
ready to go as qucickly as possible. &amp;nbsp;In retrospect, I should have gone
for &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2412"&gt;TomZ's 1x2x3 design&lt;/a&gt;, for
reasons I'll get to later. &amp;nbsp;Anyway... on to the printing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/05/15.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-908" src="/wp-uploads/2012/05/15-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The printer did a great job of producing the pieces, although it would
seem that perhaps the filament was being fed into the printer too
quickly, as tolerances were overshot, and much sanding needed to be
performed just to get it to fit together...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/05/21.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-909" src="/wp-uploads/2012/05/21-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This design included a &amp;quot;barbell&amp;quot; shaped piece that snapped between the
two halves of the core, eliminating the need for screws and springs to
hold it together and give it tension. Because of the lack of support
material, the printer had a difficult time properly printing out this
barbell, as you can see in the following picture. &amp;nbsp;There was nothing to
hold it in place, so it got dragged around a bit as the print head moved
around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/05/40.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-910" src="/wp-uploads/2012/05/40-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step I took was to sand down the parts to get them to fit. The
first thing I tried was sanding the 'feet' that protrude from the wing
pieces. I was getting decent results, but then realized that a better
solution was to sand the semicircular holes in the cores a bit more,
opening them up, making the feet spin in the core more easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/05/41.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image4" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-911" src="/wp-uploads/2012/05/41-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between various nights of heading to Interlock to work on this, and
without the needed barbell piece, I held it together with a rubber band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/05/44.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image5" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-912" src="/wp-uploads/2012/05/44-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, Joe came to my rescue. &amp;nbsp;He extracted the barbell piece out of the
STL file, sliced it in half, then printed those two halves for me. &amp;nbsp;This
time using the stylish metallic gray filament, rather than the stylish
orange filament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/05/50.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image6" class="size-medium wp-image-913 aligncenter" src="/wp-uploads/2012/05/50-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/05/53.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image7" class="size-medium wp-image-915" src="/wp-uploads/2012/05/53-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little bit of super glue, and a little bit of sanding, and they were
ready to install inside of the twisty puzzle's core. &amp;nbsp;Within minutes,&amp;nbsp;it
was assembled properly for the first time! The barbell/snap assembly is
a bit loose, and I think that some of the feet were sanded down a little
too much, as there is a lot of play in the fit of the parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/05/55.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image8" class="size-medium wp-image-914 aligncenter" src="/wp-uploads/2012/05/55-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/05/57.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image9" class="size-medium wp-image-917" src="/wp-uploads/2012/05/57-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was planning on perhaps dyeing it, or just sanding more and stickering
it with the expected color scheme (red, orange, green, blue, white,
yellow) but Nick had asked me a little about rotational symmetry of the
puzzle, and a few minutes later, he had stickered it with blue painter's
tape. It was an ingenious solution, as no two pieces are stickered with
the same pattern. (Note that you can also see the floppy tolerances on
the top left piece of the next photo.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/05/60.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image10" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-916" src="/wp-uploads/2012/05/60-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After playing with it for a while, the barbell is definitely the weak
point of the whole thing. &amp;nbsp;I had sanded it a little to get it to turn
more smoothly, but now it's way too loose. &amp;nbsp;The wing pieces are a bit
floppy due to sanding. &amp;nbsp; I think that these two things can easily be
changed for the next print, by first using TomZ's design which can use a
screw to hold it together, and also being more cautious while sanding to
keep everything within decent tolerances.&lt;/p&gt;

but I happened to see a couple of 1x2x3 designs available on

me. The puzzle I had printed was &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3737"&gt;this screwless 1x2x3

a meeting ground for its first event. The Rochester TOOOL (yes three
O's) chapter is starting up organized by Jason Ross. What's a Jason Ross
and what's a TOOOL right? Jason is the newest Interlock member and comes
from a background in security - computer security, network security,
physical security.. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://i.qkme.me/7dck.jpg"&gt;secure all the
things!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="why-lock-picking"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Lock Picking?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/04/a_misery1990.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" class="size-full wp-image-861 aligncenter" src="/wp-uploads/2012/04/a_misery1990.jpg" style="width: 590px; height: 403px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's happened to the best of us, your bloodshot eyes open to find that
you've been strapped to a bed with handcuffs again. What do you do to
get out? Call for help? Wait until the lady comes back to break your
legs like in Misery? No, you know how the locking mechanism works on a
pair of handcuffs and you shim your way out and escape through the
window to freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lock picking is learning about how locks work which turns them into a
puzzle. The number of pins in a tumbler tells you how difficult the lock
is. What does it mean when a pair of handcuffs are double locked? What
are security pins? What's the difference between a wafer lock and a pin
tumbler? If you have these questions, TOOOL is the group to talk with to
have them answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="toool"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TOOOL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.toool.us"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="http://toool.us/images/toool_logo_lg.gif" style="width: 485px; height: 176px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.toool.us"&gt;TOOOL&lt;/a&gt;is The Open Organization Of
Lockpickers. These guys love to learn and teach about locks, lock
picking, and physical security. The difference between TOOOL and a
normal locksmith, is first they don't do it for money, second, they
exchange information about locks and lock picking openly, and third,
they have more of a sense of humor than your standard locksmith. To
become a locksmith, normally you'd have to learn through an
apprenticeship. TOOOL on the other hand will be giving presentations to
the community, teaching people how to pick locks, and helping spread the
knowledge about lock picking openly to the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="legality"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Legality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is having a pair of lock picks legal? Is it against the law to know how
to lock pick? What if TSA finds a set of lock picks in your bag?? These
are all boring, but serious questions that TOOOL will answer. Here's a
hint, do you think Interlock would promote illegal activity on their
blog?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

of future meetings. There will be a presentation of some kind related to
lock picking and a lot of discussion about how future meetings will
happen. The organization requires that you become a member in order to
keep up to date on the groups activities but there will also be public
non-member, public meetings in the future. If you can't come to
tonight's meeting but you're interested in learning about how the group
works, you can email &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:algorythm%20at%20the%20gmails%20dot%20come"&gt;Jason

&lt;p&gt;Brian wowed them with his always crowd pleasing custom pen &lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}/barcamp-rochester.rst"&gt;plot-matrix
printer he's famous
for&lt;/a&gt;. The
picture above is the pre-printed artist's rendition of Seth holding his
mic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/03/DSC_8777.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-844" src="/wp-uploads/2012/03/DSC_8777-199x300.jpg" style="width: 199px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Von, Brian, and Bill put on their smart hats and answered
questions about Interlock. Von, showed off the ham radio room and his
skills for speaking with human beings. Bill spoke about his background,
why he has been involved with Interlock, and included some razzle dazzle
by printing on the 3D printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian, with his boyish good looks, sparkled on camera while showing off
his knowledge of all things blinky. I have to admit that while it's nice
to have Interlock get some PR, my first goal in setting up the interview
was to get Brian's face on TV. If you've met Brian, you'll know that
he's a very intelligent, multi-faceted, multi-facial-haired, reluctant
leader. I think that he is a very good representation of what the modern
hacker/maker looks and acts like. But, he's also not the normal talking
head you would see on TV which is why I want to get him out there even
more. I'm giggling right now thinking about seeing him on YNN now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling bad for the quiet bear-hat wearing man on the couch, YNN even
included me in a quick interview. I worked with Bill and Von on a lock
picking demo that I hope makes to air. Veronica even challenged me to a
lock picking contest where I had to go from nothing in my hands, pick up
the tools, and pick the lock. I surprisingly aced it picking a 4 pin
lock. (Thanks &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.toool.us"&gt;TOOOL&lt;/a&gt;) This will never be on the
air of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Von Brian and Bill for taking the time to come out and
intelligently represent the group. We don't know when/if the story will
air. Surprisingly, some people have more important things to hear about
than local hackerspaces but we'll let you know when.&lt;/p&gt;

suppose those that have them might post them later--but in the meantime
I figured I'd give a quick recap of my experience at our open house
Friday, before it fades too much further from active memory into the
realm of myth and legend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was, in short, a great time.&amp;nbsp; We had a fairly good variety of folks
wander through, from pre-teens on up.&amp;nbsp; I spent a while fishing out from
a small water-filled [STRIKEOUT:crockpot] slow cooker &lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}/dashing-through-the-thermoplastic-2.rst"&gt;fun little blobs
of warm
polycaprolactone&lt;/a&gt;
These I then shoved into the hands of anyone who would take them as they
wandered through our conference/presentation/meeting room. It was great
seeing folks' reaction to its warm, pliable nature and to listen to them
comment about how tough and rigid it is once cooled.&amp;nbsp; It's a very
minimalistic but (at least I'd like to think) very representative
demonstration of the interactive, collaborative, exploratory,&amp;nbsp; hand's-on
environment we try to provide at Interlock to members and guests alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a bit of a break from running my mouth and from noodling around
in the hot water and gooey PCL&amp;nbsp; to watch&amp;nbsp; a short but sweet
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://toool.us/"&gt;TOOOL&lt;/a&gt;-designed lockpicking slideshow, followed by
a lockpicking workshop.
&lt;a class="reference external" href="/author/antitree.html"&gt;Antitree&lt;/a&gt; had done the
pied-piper trick, drawing a bunch of kids-in-fact and kids-at-heart into
the conference room for a short statement of the lock picking rules, a
little bit of lock construction and mechanism theory and picking
how-to.&amp;nbsp; Then everyone took turns with the several sets of lock picking
tools and real locksets for some hand's-on experience.&amp;nbsp; Folks really
seemed to have a good time with trying it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in the space, all the folks &lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}/open-house-new-space.rst"&gt;originally promised to
appear&lt;/a&gt; were
around.&amp;nbsp; I can only guess at how awesome their presentations were, but
there seemed to be people everywhere.&amp;nbsp; Early on, I was worried no one
would make it into the not-a-kitchen for snacks, but that turned out to
be not-a-problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure how much of the traffic was driven by word-of-mouth versus
posted fliers, but I know at least some folks had seen our &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rochestercitynewspaper.com/entertainment/pop-culture/2012/03/The-gee+k-guide-to-Rochester/"&gt;lead-off
part in a feature in the independent weekly tabloid Rochester City
Newspaper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lead-up to the open house rekindled a fire under some of our 3D
printing aspirations.&amp;nbsp; I don't want to give too much away there, but
that's been bubbling along these last few weeks.&amp;nbsp; And, in addition to
folks who made it on Friday, we've also been having new folks continue
to come in for our weekly Open Night.&amp;nbsp; This week, we met John, who
brought us some fun new-to-us toys (again, perhaps more on that later,
but in the meantime, thanks, John!).&amp;nbsp; Also, we got to meet and talk to
(a different, distinct) Joe and Andrew.&amp;nbsp; And so it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you came to visit us Friday, we hope you liked what you saw and will
come back.&amp;nbsp; If you missed it, not to worry:&amp;nbsp; Please keep an eye on our
calendar for other events (at least two every week).&amp;nbsp; Or, if you can't
make it then, drop us a line and maybe we can work out an appointment
for some other time.&lt;/p&gt;

we'll be feeding you. Members are bringing in food in a pot-luck style.
Mostly things to nibble at so bring an appetite. Eating and hacking;
does it get better? Well... yeah but it's still pretty cool right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/6779620792/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Pencil Plotter 1" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7041/6779620792_76736d9442_z.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tada! Did you know they make mechanical pencils that auto-advance their
lead? I didn't, until this was mentioned on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://music.columbia.edu/mailman/listinfo/chiplotle-discuss"&gt;a mailing
list&lt;/a&gt;
I'm on for discussing the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://music.columbia.edu/cmc/chiplotle/"&gt;Chiplotle&lt;/a&gt; python plotter
library (and plotters in general).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick Amazon Prime-ing of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I6ZM20"&gt;BIC AI mechanical
pencil&lt;/a&gt; and away we go.
I stuck it into a hollowed out plotter pen, as demonstrated above, and
it seemed to work fine and auto-advance the lead whenever necessary.
Sweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/6925751889/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Pencil Plotter 2" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7187/6925751889_d17b938b7c_z.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for the two of you out there interested in pen plotters, now you
know. For the rest of you, maybe you've got an
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://egg-bot.com/"&gt;Eggbot&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://store.makerbot.com/toolheads/makerbot-unicorn-pen-plotter-kit.html"&gt;Makerbot
Unicorn&lt;/a&gt;
or some cool sort of &lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}/barcamp-rochester.rst"&gt;homebrewed
plotter&lt;/a&gt;... go
get it running with some genuine [STRIKEOUT:100% lead] &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pencil"&gt;mixture of
graphite with clay binder&lt;/a&gt;. And
if you're into drawing and/or robots and/or software, you should stop in
and play with the plotters someday. I'll get you started, so bring in
some vector artwork, and maybe some paper, and we'll see what happens!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other project was to figure out how to downgrade FireFox on Ubuntu.
FireFox 9 broke a plugin but there appears to be no way to downgrade
back to FireFox 8 on Ubuntu. Apparently all the older versions of
FireFox have been removed from the repositories. The older version can
be downloaded and installed manually but the requirement is for a simple
maintainable way to install so old laptops can be supplied to kids with
the kid friendly FireFox plugin. The plugin is just a version of a
Windows app that uses IE so now the challenge will be to see if that app
will run in wine. Maybe we'll have an answer by next month.&lt;/p&gt;

decided to break my &amp;quot;never leave the house or have meaningful human

threshold for this odd behavior is quite high, but I just couldn't bring
myself to miss the first meeting of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.meetup.com/HackshackersROC/"&gt;Hacks/Hackers
Rochester&lt;/a&gt;, a local group
aiming to mush together journalists, programmers, technologists,
designers, and what-have-you, just to see what kind of nutty/useful
stuff results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/6726571927/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Hacks &amp;amp; Hackers Rochester" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7152/6726571927_7fd2e9714b_z.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get too far, I'll have you know that their next meeting is
Wednesday, February 15th (at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rit.edu/"&gt;RIT's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rit.edu/innovationcenter/"&gt;Center for
Student Innovation&lt;/a&gt;), and you
can get at them on their &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.meetup.com/HackshackersROC/"&gt;meetup
group&lt;/a&gt;, or their &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/#!/hackshackersroc/"&gt;twittery
bits&lt;/a&gt;. If combining
technology and journalism sounds fun to you, you should stop by, because
it seemed like a bunch of smart and interesting people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok. For the rest of our time together, I'm fixin' to dump a few links on
you. I am not a journalist, nor a programmer, but I have been quite
interested in this area for some time, and hope to contribute – at the
very least – as a well-informed cheerleader, brainstormer, facilitator,
or village idiot. We'll see. Either way, maybe I can give interested
parties some ideas of what's possible/probable before the next meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="open-sesame"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Open Sesame&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Open&amp;quot; excites me. Open source software, open hardware designs, open
data, &amp;quot;free culture&amp;quot; in general. Fun things happen when information is
free and accessible. Maybe this first dawned on me when I saw the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://oakland.crimespotting.org/"&gt;Oakland Crimespotting site&lt;/a&gt;. By
now, everybody has seen a multitude of visualizations made by dumping
data on top of Google Maps. Back then it was pretty new and exciting.
What struck me most, at the time, was that the Oakland PD was publishing
this data to a public website, and in a format that was fairly easily
scrape-able and parse-able. Wow! Amazingly pedestrian, really, but for a
city or county government it seemed unthinkable (and still does,
apparently).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many municipalities are doing a decent job in this area nowadays. Some
have even progressed enough that sites like
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.everyblock.com/"&gt;EveryBlock&lt;/a&gt; have sprung up, taking these
public data feeds and massaging them into a format that mere mortals can
make sense of. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://data.baltimorecity.gov/"&gt;Baltimore has an open data
website&lt;/a&gt; that looks like it has lots
of useful info, in easy to digest formats. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://data.cityofchicago.org/"&gt;Chicago
too&lt;/a&gt;. I'm sure there are many
others... those were just the first two to pop up when I poked around
for &amp;quot;data dot blah blah dot gov&amp;quot; sites. There is no
data.cityofrochester.gov site, unfortunately. How do we make that
happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="dumpy-data"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dumpy Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we rely on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.foia.gov/"&gt;FOIA&lt;/a&gt; requests for
information from local governments. Often times, these arrive in the
least convenient format possible, and they are likely full of sloppy and
inconsistent data. We're pretty lucky then, that after cleaning things
up, the D&amp;amp;C often shares this data with us on their
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://rocdocs.democratandchronicle.com/"&gt;RocDocs&lt;/a&gt; site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if they know about &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/"&gt;Google
Refine&lt;/a&gt;? Refine is &amp;quot;a power
tool for working with messy data, cleaning it up, transforming it from
one format into another, extending it with web services, and linking it
to databases like &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.freebase.com/"&gt;Freebase&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot; If you're
dealing with cruddy data of any sort, you should check it out. It's a
bit of a weird install, running as a web server on your computer. Ask
your &lt;a class="reference external" href="/"&gt;local nerds&lt;/a&gt; if you're having
trouble... it's worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="community-data"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Community Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you can get it in a decent format, governments don't always have
the data you need. Or if they do, it might be stale by the time you can
get at it. There are some fun things happening in the world of open data
acquisition. Let's call it &amp;quot;open mapping&amp;quot;, although I'm sure there are
non-location-based projects I'm overlooking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, Google is changing the terms of service on their Maps product...
taking it out of &amp;quot;beta&amp;quot; status and reaching into your wallet for some
payback. If you have a certain amount of map views per day, it's no
longer free to use. Thankfully, all along, a large community of folks
have been creating their own street maps by compiling open government
data (TIGER files in the US), or by walking, biking, and driving routes
with a GPS logger and uploading their tracks.
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/"&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt; is the result, and
it's an amazing feat. Anybody can edit the map... so feel free to liken
it to the &amp;quot;Wikipedia of maps&amp;quot;, even though that probably makes some
people bristle. Not coincidentally, the resultant data is available
under a farily open license, and has thus been mixed and remixed into a
plenitude of other projects, products, and experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.opencyclemap.org/"&gt;OpenCycleMap&lt;/a&gt; builds upon
OpenStreetMap, and highlights cycling routes. It is rather sparse in the
US. I recently attended some public meetings on Rochester's bicycle
plan, featuring some large maps of city streets rated &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; through &amp;quot;F&amp;quot;
for bike safety. Perhaps that belongs on such a map, editable by all
those who actually ride the city streets and know that traffic volume
and speed are not the only relevant dimensions for such a grade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/02/tilemill_screenshot.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-814" src="/wp-uploads/2012/02/tilemill_screenshot.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 389px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.openheatmap.com/"&gt;OpenHeatMap&lt;/a&gt; lets you upload a
spreadsheet of data and crank out a heat map on top of OpenStreetMap.
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mapbox.com/"&gt;Mapbox&lt;/a&gt; is a bit more sophisticated, but costs
some money for hosted maps. No matter... the Mapbox developers have
released &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill/"&gt;TileMill&lt;/a&gt;, a gorgeous
application that lets you handcraft interactive maps yourself. It
requires a bit more knowhow, but I'm sure Hacks/Hackers has plenty of
that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The folks at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.safecast.org/"&gt;Safecast&lt;/a&gt; wanted to map
radiation levels following the Fukushima disaster in Japan, so they
cobbled together some GPS loggers and Geiger counters. After driving
around the country, they plopped the data on top of the OpenStreetMap.
This isn't child's play yet, but every day it's getting easier to bring
together the hardware and software needed to record data and make it
easily available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-brief-aside"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Brief Aside&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These radiation mappers weren't &amp;quot;traditional journalists&amp;quot;. Maybe it
wasn't even journalism or news. Whatever. It was really important info,
and I'll bet no reporter thought &amp;quot;I'll just go out and record that data,
instead of waiting by the phone for an official report&amp;quot;. I hope, after
hanging out at Hacks/Hackers, that mindset will change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semi-related: Rochester has &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://rocwiki.org/Ginna_Nuclear_Power_Plant"&gt;a nuclear power
plant&lt;/a&gt; nearby, and
Interlock has a Geiger counter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/6190437602/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Geiger Counter" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6145/6190437602_041ccdbf22_z.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(not a terribly well calibrated Geiger counter, admittedly)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some more thoughts on the future of local news and journalism, from
people much smarter and more cogent than I, I will simply link without
comment to some posts I've bookmarked from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ryansholin.com/2007/06/02/10-obvious-things-about-the-future-of-newspapers-you-need-to-get-through-your-head/"&gt;Ryan

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="burbling-infobrooks"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Burbling Infobrooks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If real-time info is needed, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pachube.com/"&gt;Pachube&lt;/a&gt; is a
free clearinghouse for data feeds. It's ridiculously easy to upload
sensor data to the site, whether it be temperature, weather, energy use,
and so on. Equally important, it's also easy to retrieve that
information as a regularly updated and well-documented stream. Would you
like to browse the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pachube.com/feeds?q=radiation"&gt;2700 available feeds tagged
&amp;quot;radiation&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; on Pachube?
Probably not. But it'd be a relatively simple task to create a program
that retrieves and maps them in an easy to digest format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some folks – mainly in New York City – weren't quite satisfied with the
current status quo of air quality monitoring. So they're &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://airqualityegg.wikispaces.com/"&gt;building their
own sensor network&lt;/a&gt; using open
platforms to measure and make the data available to anybody that wants
it, in real time. This stuff isn't too technically challenging nowadays.
We just need to pair up those with a need for info with the people who
know how to get this stuff done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="too-long-still-reading"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Too Long; Still Reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's plenty more fun stuff happening in this area, but that's enough
to keep you occupied for a few hours a least. If – after you close all
your browser tabs – you still find your cravings unfulfilled, do &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.meetup.com/HackshackersROC/"&gt;join
us at the next meeting&lt;/a&gt;, or
fire away in the comments here. I'm sure we'll be able to fill up or
otherwise utilize your vast cranial resources. See you there!&lt;/p&gt;

after I arrived my laptop, a MacBook Pro, died. When I pushed the power
button the fans would spin and the optical drive would do a seek but
there was nothing on the screen. About 1 out of 3 times I could hear the
startup gong. I could plug it into a network and ssh into the laptop so
I knew the machine was running - just nothing on the screen. I tried an
external monitor but there was nothing there either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I searched the net and tried all the standard resetting of the PRAM,
booting from dvd and anything I could but there was no change. So I
bought a new Lenovo laptop, installed Linux and restored all my personal
files from backups over the network from home. Very slow but within two
days I had a working laptop and continued with my work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After five more months I still wasn't happy with my new laptop. I had
everything I needed working but there were a bunch of little annoyances.
So I decided to spend an afternoon trying to resurrect my MacBook Pro. I
started by going to ifixit.com for some pointers on disassembling and
checking on things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ifixit.com/Device/MacBook_Pro_15%22_Core_2_Duo_Models_A1226_and_A1260"&gt;http://www.ifixit.com/Device/MacBook_Pro_15%22_Core_2_Duo_Models_A1226_and_A1260&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the small philips screw driver and the torx driver but I didn't
have a spudger (and really had never heard of it). But I was able to use
a small flat blade screw driver very carefully and managed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First I opened it and tried removing/moving/replacing the ram modules
just to make sure - do the easy things first even if they aren't likely
to do anything. Then I tried checking any and all connectors -
disconnect, reconnect and test again. I followed all the cables that had
anything to do with video to see if maybe one was broken. After checking
all of this there still was no change in the behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some more searching it seemed like the last thing to try was to
reflow the solder on the GPU. There were several videos about doing this
both specifically for the MacBook Pro and for video cards in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jFTi_P24z8&amp;amp;feature=related"&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jFTi_P24z8&amp;amp;feature=related&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_uN6VBqWkg&amp;amp;feature=related"&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_uN6VBqWkg&amp;amp;feature=related&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the laptop was useless as it was I had nothing to lose. So I
continued the disassembling until I had the main logic board free. There
were lots of screws and many tiny little connectors to all the other
bits in the case. I was fairly sure it would never work again because I
doubted my ability to get everything connected correctly again but I
pushed on. I cleaned all the heat sink compound off the cpu, gpu and
interface chips. Using the heat gun at our soldering station, I heated
the the little board holding the gpu onto the logic board focusing on
any solder joints I could see. After ten minutes of this it seemed like
the solder I could see was a little shinier and the board was certainly
hot. So I started the long process of assembling the laptop again.
Getting all the little connectors on top of the logic board and
reconnected was quite a tedious process. Then getting all the screws
back was also lots of fun. I tried keeping the screws generally laid out
in groups by where they came from but there was still a lot of hunting
for a hole that the screw would fit in. But eventually I had it all back
together with no left over parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the moment of truth. It was late and time to go home so I waited
until everything was back together and plugged in. Then I pushed the
power button and the startup gong sounded. Then wonder of wonders, the
screen lit up and the system booted all the way up. I was able to login
and the system was working perfectly! Several days later and everything
is still fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for a few hours work I have a my laptop back.&lt;/p&gt;

thing I was held up on was getting the main structure built. I had done
a design in Sketch-Up, but had no idea how to actually get it made for
real. It turns out there are several options for getting acrylic designs
produced. In this case, I chose water-jet because it leaves a nice edge
on the finished parts. I wrote up a pretty detailed set of instructions
for building the robot structure on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucabot/wiki/Stand-Assembly"&gt;project
wiki&lt;/a&gt;. In
those, I talk about the production of the parts and assembly process. It
details how I used Weld-On #3 to bond the parts. This works very well
for acrylic since it sets up fast, creates a fast bond and is relatively

thing I was held up on was getting the main structure built. I had done
a design in Sketch-Up, but had no idea how to actually get it made for
real. It turns out there are several options for getting acrylic designs
produced. In this case, I chose water-jet because it leaves a nice edge
on the finished parts. I wrote up a pretty detailed set of instructions
for building the robot structure on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucabot/wiki/Stand-Assembly"&gt;project
wiki&lt;/a&gt;. In
those, I talk about the production of the parts and assembly process. It
details how I used Weld-On #3 to bond the parts. This works very well
for acrylic since it sets up fast, creates a fast bond and is relatively
easy to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

taking every opportunity I could to practice making these &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.en.origami-club.com/fun/balloon/ballon/index.html"&gt;origami
cubical
&amp;quot;balloons&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;
using scraps of wrapping paper. I made in excess of a dozen, and that
was the high point of my recent kick to practice enough to be able to do
this pattern from memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a maker-theory perspective, even with the digital revolution and
the move to e-texts to replace things, like books, that have
traditionally used paper, paper as a material is still ubiquitous and
cheap. Its ready availability means that one can cultivate the maker
state of mind just about any where--I started out on this recent origami
journey after lunch one day a couple of months ago, using the
coated-paper basket liner at a burrito place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paper fast-food tray liners and place mats do pretty well in a pinch,
and making something then and there is a great way to entertain a
youngster or to open a discussion with an indulgent friend, co-worker,
or even a stranger, about the fun to be had as a hacker and maker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amongst different types of paper, paper sold as &amp;quot;origami paper&amp;quot; can be a
little more hard to find and more expensive. I also try to resist that
tendency projects have to lead off with &amp;quot;first, go out and buy
something&amp;quot;. So I set out to figure out &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://deejoe.posterous.com/recycled-paper-origami"&gt;a way consistently to convert
randomly-shaped scraps of
paper&lt;/a&gt; into
squares suitable for use with traditional origami patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, at my last turn on door duty for Interlock's &amp;quot;Do Night&amp;quot; I
worked on expanding my repertoire a little bit, learning how to make
these
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.en.origami-club.com/traditional/box2/box2/index.html"&gt;open-topped&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.en.origami-club.com/traditional/candybox/candybox/index.html"&gt;boxes.&lt;/a&gt;
Also, Reggie was a pretty ggod sport about taking some instruction from
me about how to fold up his own balloon made from wrapping paper I
pushed on him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I'm not that enthused about making little animals. Also, I had
my paper airplane phase as a kid, so that doesn't hold a lot of appeal
for me at the moment. Mostly, pure geometry, as in the balloon-cubes,
and potentially useful knick-knacks, like the candy box, are what I've
been after. With the holidays gone, my interest may fade for a bit.
We'll see.&lt;/p&gt;

Nexus is getting a lot of press about it. You may have heard of Google
Wallet or how NFC is going to be built into smart phones in the future.
Maybe you haven't thought about how it works or how to hack it.&amp;nbsp;As a
side[side(side)] project I've been working on NFC research with (as
always for me) a specific focus on the security perspectives. This is an
overview of NFC to maybe peak your interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define:NFC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near Field Communication is a way to transmit information between
intelligent devices. I know you're already thinking Bluetooth but wait.
NFC has a limitation that says in its spec that it can't be more than
.2m away from its partner during communication. It may be a bit more
depending on the implementation but the thing to remember here is that
the protocol itself is what limits the distance, not just the hardware.
(Quit pointing that gigantic antenna at my pocket right now!) It
transmits on the HF band 13.56MHz, a frequency already used by some RFID
chips and fun devices like the Proxmark 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what's different about NFC: There are three different modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reader/Writer: Commonly used in smart posters or smart stickers.
Think QR code but subtle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peer to Peer: Data is exchanged back and forth between devices;
securely exchange credit cards, give your friend your home WIFI
settings, or exchange business cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Card Emulation: A device acts like a contactless smart card. What if
you could use your phone as a bus pass instead of keeping that flimsy
magstripe pass in your pocket?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NFC != RFID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets take care of that up front. NFC sounds a lot like RFID (they share
the whole RF thing) and it seems to get stored in people's heads that
way because NFC has the card emulation mode where it emulates at &amp;quot;tag&amp;quot;
or an RFID chip. &amp;nbsp;RFID isn't usually much more than a tag blindly
broadcasting data hoping a receiver picks it up. Passive tags (or little
antennas without a power source) sit and wait for an RFID reader to come
by to energize them. They get all excited and tell the reader everything
they know. Imagine a dog just waiting at the door for it's owner to come
home. The active RFID tags have a battery in them that constantly
broadcasts itself to anyone that will listen. Kind of like that annoying
friend you have that tells you everything about their life even though
you never asked. NFC on the other hand is like an intelligent college
student. She can have an intimate conversation with you, she can make a
presentation in front of a class, but she can still get drunk and act
stupid if that's what everyone else is doing at the party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NFC is not a new technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've seen them in European phones since 2003 or 4 and they've been
hacked on for just as long. The folks at the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ccc.de/en/"&gt;Chaos Computer
Club&lt;/a&gt; have been hacking on NFC since it's
original inception; when manufacturers like Nokia started installing it
into their feature phones, AKA dumb phones. It never made it across the
water - some may say due to some FCC regulations on the 13.56 frequency
but I'll leave that topic to the Ham guys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security|image1|&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven't already, you should put on your tin foil hat now. &lt;strong&gt;NFC
is a way for corporations to take over our bodies, man!&lt;/strong&gt; Well...most
likely not. But you're already thinking about the security problems as
soon as I wrote &amp;quot;credit card.&amp;quot; I'm going to save this whole discussion
for another day but the tl;dr version is that NFC has been designed with
security in mind but a lot is left up to the developer to implement
securely. We all know how well that works especially for mobile app
developers so I'm sure everything is going to be fine, right? Maybe next
time I'll tell you about the butt sniffing attack. No seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Android and The Galaxy Nexus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is Android implementing NFC in the Galaxy Nexus? Here's an example
of a peer to peer mode connection: When you put a Galaxy Nexus next to
another Galaxy Nexus, the phone will make an NFC connection as long as
both phones are unlocked. If the app that you &amp;nbsp;have open supports NFC
(i.e. Google Maps) it will allow you to communicate data from your app
to the other device. Some examples of this are sharing contact
information, location data, websites, etc but apparently it's going to
be used for games or whatever developers can think of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Reader/Writer mode will allow you to take an NFC tag and shove it
next to the phone. Depending on the data stored on the card, it will
open an appropriate app to view the content. In the case of an NFC tag
that is contains a URL, it will automatically go to that page. Ask me
about some of the NFC tags I've made at a 2600 meeting sometime. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The build was pretty involved, but with a group of four folks we managed
to get the majority of the work done in one long Sunday, a time-lapse of
which follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That resulted in the following structure, which just needed to have its
nozzle and build platform installed (and quite a bit of wiring).&lt;/p&gt;

messing with long strings of electrical wire, crazy light bulbs, and
LEDs plus all sorts of weird objects made of ceramic, glass, metal or
plastic. I was inspired to offset some of my Grinchiness by using our
put-up-the-decorations day as another opportunity to use one of my new
favorite materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Christmas tree stand has this nifty tiered collection of what are,
essentially, big set screws, designed to hold the trunk of the tree
upright in the center of the tree stand. Problem is, over time we've
lost the little plastic caps from the trunk end of several of the set
screws. This means the set screws tear up the bark of the tree trunk
more quickly, and dig more easily into the trunk of the tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That can't be good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" src="http://deejoe.etrumeus.com/interlock/PCL-tree-stand/10-PCL-tree-stand-missing-caps-sxga.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, another of our tree stands, smaller, with only one tier of set
screws, has a nice little conical stand-off built into the bottom of the
stand, to help keep the bottom of the tree off the bottom of the stand.
That way water can get into the bottom and up through the tree. The
larger stand that we like to use, with two tiers of set screws, has no
such stand-off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I made little caps out of
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycaprolactone"&gt;PCL&lt;/a&gt;
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://reprap.org/wiki/Polycaprolactone"&gt;polycaprolactone&lt;/a&gt;, aka

Plastic&lt;/a&gt;,
about which perhaps more some other time) to replace the missing ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a mold out of some &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer_clay"&gt;polymer
clay&lt;/a&gt; using the OEM green
cap and made one PCL cap with the mold. Using polymer clay this way is
something I've been meaning to try. Sad to say, that approach still
needs a little work--I had a lot of trouble with the PCL locking into
small imperfections in the mold. The rest of the replacement caps I made
by just pressing warm PCL around the ends of the set screws, free form,
and then letting them cool and harden in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also made a little PCL stand-off to put in the bottom of the tree,
with a little &amp;quot;spider&amp;quot; consisting of two crossed PCL rods to help keep
it near the center of the bottom of the well of the stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" src="http://deejoe.etrumeus.com/interlock/PCL-tree-stand/30-PCL-tree-stand-standoff-sxga.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here they are, all together:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" src="http://deejoe.etrumeus.com/interlock/PCL-tree-stand/40-PCL-tree-stand-with-new-parts-sxga.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The caps seem to have worked pretty well. The spider kept slipping out
of place as I was trying to get the stand fit onto the tree. Next year
maybe I'll try putting something soft and sticky on the ends to help
with more of a press-fit, either some sort of generic silicone caulk or
some &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sugru.com/"&gt;Sugru&lt;/a&gt; or something.&lt;/p&gt;

access to the roof.&amp;nbsp; On a beautiful fall day, Chris Olin and I put up a
30’ fiberglass mast on a tripod base (not attached to the roof).&amp;nbsp; Then
we hoisted up a trapped dipole for 10-80 meters and a G5RV.&amp;nbsp; The dipole
is oriented SW-NE, the G5RV is SE-NW.&amp;nbsp; We also put up a 2m/70 cm J-Pole
for VHF/UHF.&amp;nbsp; All the feedlines were run with previously used 8/U down
to our space (about 150’) and into the Ham Shack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We initially had a Kenwood TS-530s transceiver and roller tuner setup
for HF and we made a few contacts.&amp;nbsp; We wanted to get the Yaesu FT-857GX
out of the storage container and try it out.&amp;nbsp; That is setup now along
with an automatic tuner.&amp;nbsp; Reception seems decent.&amp;nbsp; We are waiting on an
operable microphone to get back on the air.&amp;nbsp; Bill, Von, Rowan, and Steve
are working on that.&amp;nbsp; We will be working on CAT control and a hook-up
for using SDR like functionality with Ham Radio Deluxe, allowing us to
get into the digital communication modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Yaesu FT-8800 VHF/UHF rig is working well, K2HAX normally monitors
146.61 (N2MPE local ARES/RACES repeater) while someone is in the shack.
We have cables for programming this rig on order and also have a cable
for use with the PacComm TNC for packet, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have a desktop PC with a nice monitor setup for use with the
transceivers.&amp;nbsp; We are waiting on a 2 port serial card to communicate
with the radios.&amp;nbsp; The remote programming of the radios and the option
for digital mode communications (PSK, Packet, etc) opens up with the PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our bench includes power supplies, frequency counters, various
multi-meters and hand tools.&amp;nbsp; We have a great selection of soldering
tools for discrete and SMT component work.&amp;nbsp; We have a variable
temperature iron and a variable speed and temperature blower for
re-work.&amp;nbsp; On order is a Hakko 808 de-soldering tool.&amp;nbsp; We have 2 antenna
analyzers, a new Comet and an older MFJ.&amp;nbsp; Several bench projects are
already underway including Jamie’s whispering clocks, many cable hacks
for the radios, and Walter’s attempts to repair blown audio equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ham radio is witnessing a rebirth in popularity.&amp;nbsp; Emergency preparedness
at the county/state/and national level has recognized the value of Ham
radio as the most dependable means for communication during an
emergency.&amp;nbsp; Interlock members have participated in local POD drills,
Ginna nuclear event practice response teams and are regular attendees at
the local ARES/RACES meetings.&amp;nbsp; Ham Radio can provide texting, TV and
many other familiar forms of communication without any annoying
infrastructure.&amp;nbsp; We can DX with Ham operators around the world, by voice
and many new and old digital modes.&amp;nbsp; SDR is an emerging technology
applied to Ham radio; opening up some fantastic possibilities for low
power operation, contesting, and pulling weak signals out of the noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ham radio is growing in popularity.&amp;nbsp; Interlock Hams would love to
introduce anyone interested to the hobby and answer any questions you
may have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's true, we've managed to move all of our gear and junk into a new
space. We're in the same building, but we've now got over twice the
space, and some delineation between a workshop sort of room, and other

&lt;p&gt;It's true, we've managed to move all of our gear and junk into a new
space. We're in the same building, but we've now got over twice the
space, and some delineation between a workshop sort of room, and other
rooms that are more office-like. Above, you can see a shot of the new
workshop. It's pretty close to the size of our entire previous space,
and we're excited to fill it up with useful tools and fun projects. The
first step though, was painting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to having more space, we also finally got roof access. That,
plus a particularly motivated new-ish member (Walter), means that we
already have a respectable antenna farm installed up there, perfect for
the roughly 50% of our membership with ham licenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/6359765801/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Antenna Farm" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6214/6359765801_3fce69d5f9_z.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've set aside a whole room for all the ham gear and a secondary
electronics workbench (although it's already surpassing the main bench
as far as sweet gear goes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/6356820667/"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Ham Shack" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6218/6356820667_69192ab54b_z.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The network goons have a server closet now, so normal humans can be
isolated from the constant whine of small fans and hard drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/6356747205/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Server Room" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6240/6356747205_a4ebf9d8f1_z.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a large room set up as a classroom or conference room, perfect
for some upcoming classes that are in the works, and nicely isolated
from other noisy activities in the space. I reckon we can accommodate a
dozen people per class, if they all need hands-on desk space, and more
if it's just rows of chairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/6356784025/"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Classroom / Conference Room" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6057/6356784025_38d6222dbb_z.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's more to the space that hasn't been shown here. Three more rooms
in fact... some of which we're not quite sure what to do with. If you
want to see more pictures, there's always &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/interlock_roc/pool/"&gt;our flickr

&lt;p&gt;As is usually the case, Interlock managed to cajole/bribe the organizers
of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://barcamproc.org/"&gt;BarCamp Rochester&lt;/a&gt; into giving us a table
in the atrium, upon which we could set up our wares and lure in
unsuspecting geeks. The conference itself was really great, with lots of
interesting talks, and lots of attendees and traffic by our table.
Everybody seemed quite excited about the &amp;quot;Skeletonizing Carcasses with
Flesh-eating Beetles&amp;quot; talk, myself included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, we've had a slight lack of table-sized projects that moved,
made noise, or otherwise stimulated people to come talk to us and see
what Interlock is all about... but no longer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2011/10/DSC_84971.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-666" src="/wp-uploads/2011/10/DSC_84971-1024x678.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After becoming a little obsessed with &lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}/plottopotamus.rst"&gt;old pen
plotters&lt;/a&gt; over the
past few months, I decided I'd like to try assembling my own drawing
robot. The main goal, again, was to have something small, cool, and
interactive to attract folks at events where we have a table or booth.
So about a month ago, our journey started with destruction... one
printer and one printer/scanner gave their slightly non-functional lives
to this project. Anything slightly cool was saved, and of course the
precision rods, stepper motors, and timing belts were the main goal. I
wanted this to use pin-feed card stock, so an old dot-matrix printer was
also sacrificed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was without camera for most of the month, so documentation is
non-existent. Regardless, the documentation would have been something
like this: &amp;quot;!&amp;#64;#$!&amp;#64;#$ MORE EPOXY! !&amp;#64;#%!#$&amp;quot;, along with pictures of me
looking frustrated. Let's just say, this machine is a hack, on top of a
kludge, wrapped in a cob-job. We ended up with the paper-feed mechanism
from the dot-matrix printer acting as the Y axis, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/412"&gt;a small solenoid
from adafruit&lt;/a&gt; riding along on
the X axis with a wobbly pen-holder (and some tape (and epoxy!)). This
was all hooked up to a rickety breadboard (I designed and ordered an
Arduino shield via &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://batchpcb.com"&gt;Batch PCB&lt;/a&gt;, but it didn't
arrive in time) with two &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/1201"&gt;Polulu stepper
drivers&lt;/a&gt;, an Arduino, and
a simple transistor doohicky for toggling the solenoid. We ran
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/simen/grbl"&gt;grbl&lt;/a&gt; on the Arduino, and after
tracking down a bug in said code and reflashing the firmware, we were
well on our way. I learned a lot, stressed a bit, and the morning of
BarCamp we barely managed this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2011/10/DSC_8494.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-672" src="/wp-uploads/2011/10/DSC_8494-1024x678.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it got better throughout the day, with some live on-the-scene
hacking. I managed to get a toolchain set up to get webcam input traced
and plotted thusly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/6294760604/"&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG_8267" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6039/6294760604_cbcfdc264e_z.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That toolchain starts with
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/"&gt;OpenCV&lt;/a&gt; handling the webcam,
and doing a &amp;quot;trace outlines&amp;quot; sort of procedure. From there, a PNG is
saved, converted to vectors by
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://autotrace.sourceforge.net/"&gt;autotrace&lt;/a&gt;, converted from eps to
hpgl (the language of old-timey plotters) by
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.pstoedit.net/"&gt;pstoedit&lt;/a&gt;, slurped back into Python via
the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://music.columbia.edu/cmc/chiplotle/"&gt;Chiplotle HPGL
library&lt;/a&gt;, where I have a
few routines scale and optimize the tool path, and then we output some
ugly gcode and stream it to the Arduino. Phew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a bit roundabout. But it worked, and it made people smile and
wander over to talk to us... and they got some cool robo-portraits out
of it. I'll leave you with another image and video of the bot doing its
thing. A few more can be found in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/sets/72157628015314436/detail/"&gt;my flickr

&lt;p&gt;Surely this will be my last poorly documented project: a hands-free foot
operated documentation camera. I thought it'd be handy, and I had an old
broken desk lamp kicking around, so of course, the two must be mushed
together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started out with an old Canon SD1000, with
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/CHDK"&gt;CHDK&lt;/a&gt; installed of course. For
those in the dark, CHDK is an alternate firmware that works on lots of
point and shoot cameras (not just Canon, anymore), and it lets you run
scripts, save pictures as raw files, and tweak every setting you could
ever possibly want to. It's awesome, and I needed it so I could trigger
the shutter via an external button (you basically toggle +5v on one of
the USB port pins).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/6076628007/"&gt;&lt;img alt="DSC_6902.jpg" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6205/6076628007_f98976013f.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 333px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't want to worry about running out of batteries mid-shoot, so I
printed a dummy battery at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.shapeways.com/"&gt;Shapeways&lt;/a&gt;,
ran some wires through it, then tinned and bent over the ends of them to
make some pseudo &amp;quot;terminals&amp;quot;. These went out a hole I drilled in the
battery door, through the lamp, to a simple 5v voltage regulator, wired
up straight out of the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.national.com/ds/LM/LM109.pdf"&gt;datasheet&lt;/a&gt;. This 5v source
also goes through an old lamp foot switch to the camera's USB port, for

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I took to the lathe to make an adapter between the weird lamp
thread and standard camera tripod thread (1/4&amp;quot; diameter, 20 threads per
inch). I used a bit of round delrin stock, bored out the appropriate
diameters, and just cranked a bolt through rather than threading things
properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried a few test shots last night, while I put together &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mightyohm.com/blog/products/geiger-counter/"&gt;Mighty Ohm's
Geiger Counter
Kit&lt;/a&gt;. It works
pretty well, but can't really zoom in close enough to document very fine
work. Hopefully it will still be useful for documenting other tasks that
require both your hands in frame. Failing that, I'm sure there will be
other uses for a scriptable camera attached to a flexible-yet-solid
base... perhaps it will turn into a time-lapse-bot.&lt;/p&gt;

Faire was a new intense gathering of super positive people. Where else
can you say you saw a giant hydrolic fire breathing dragon next to a one

&lt;p&gt;Really the only reason I went down was to volunteer at the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.toool.us"&gt;TOOOL&lt;/a&gt; booth with a couple of friends. I spent
the weekend teaching kids and adults how to pick locks. I'll just say
that I don't hang around kids very much but teaching an 8 year old how
to pick locks was pretty freaking cool. But the highlight of my weekend
was teaching an NYPD officer how to pick a master lock.&lt;/p&gt;

toy, a Roland DPX-3300 pen plotter... delivered via ebay from the
magical futurepast of the early nineties. For those that are out of the
loop with the past century, pen plotters are two axis robo-thingamajigs
that basically pick up pens and draw on paper with them. They've been
replaced by wide-format inkjet printers, but they used to be quite
popular with anybody who wanted to plot out maps, blueprints, and other
large diagrams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/5937490274/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Interlock Plotty Pictures 1" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6125/5937490274_0b95dfca21.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 333px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, somehow I caught the plotter bug, even going so far as to learn
a bit of python after finding this neat library called
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://music.columbia.edu/cmc/chiplotle/"&gt;Chiplotle&lt;/a&gt; that handles
the basics of creating and streaming artwork to plotters using their
native language of HPGL. They have a mailing list where they often point
out good plotter deals on ebay, and I foolishly/accidentally purchased
perhaps the biggest flatbed plotter out there. 3x2 feet of plotting
goodness, 100 pounds of steel and stepper motors delivered to my door by
a grumpy UPS driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/5936937271/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Interlock Plotty Pictures 2" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6009/5936937271_0e87fb9250.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 333px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After realizing it doesn't fit anywhere in my house, I brought it to
Interlock and have been tinkering with it since. The first step was to
convert old dried out plotter pens into pen holders that would allow me
to use Sharpies or other art pens with the device. That involved a quick
trip to the lathe, which I hope to document more fully in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/5936918129/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Interlock Plotty Pictures 3" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6006/5936918129_7d4e1d4a2e.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 333px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having figured out an inexpensive pen solution, I really wanted to make
drawings based on webcam input... so I trawled around the internet and
mailing lists until I could piece together a passable solution using
OpenCV's python bindings, and a series of nerdy unixy commands (convert,
autotrace, and pstoedit) to trace, mush, and output the data. You can
find the relevant code up on my &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beardicus/ronald_toys%20"&gt;Ronald
Toys&lt;/a&gt; Github repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having conquered such menial tasks, I decided that the default route the
plotter was taking was quite inefficient, with lots of time spent
seeking back and forth between lines. My precious robot was spending
half its time flailing due to a poorly composed hpgl file. Surely there
was a better way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beardicus/ronald_tools%20"&gt;Tada!&lt;/a&gt; I wrote a
really dumb sort routine that attempts to minimize seeking between
lines, instead of blindly accepting the order that autotrace wrote them
in. You can see the difference in the following two time-lapse videos.
The first shows the default route that autotrace produces, and the
second is my optimized version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next step for this project: some more sophisticated drawing routines,
including some cross-hatched shading, color, and maybe even some 3D
input from a Kinect. Stop in for a Tuesday Open Night and maybe you can
be a robo-portrait guinea pig!&lt;/p&gt;

and a third of the tablets. I've been focused on Android lately and
wanted to do an&amp;nbsp;introduction&amp;nbsp;to the hackability of these devices.&amp;nbsp;From a
security perspective, Android offers some interesting opportunities:
rooting your phone, hacking an app, or malware analysis. For the
hardware hackers, Google and others are offering hardware tools that can
plug into your Android device to enable use them for your hardware
projects. If you're interested in the creative path, it's really easy to
get started doing app development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rooting:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rooting your device offers the user full control of the device to allow
to change the version of the operating system, install or uninstall any
apps you'd like, and in some cases gain access to features that would
otherwise be locked out by the carrier. If none of those interest you,
the geek cred alone may be good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rooting is nothing more than a&amp;nbsp;privilege&amp;nbsp;escalation attack. You are
granted standard user access to your phone but you'd like to escalate to
root level&amp;nbsp;privileges. Android, being built on top of Linux follows the
common practice of granting root only when necessary to your device's
operations. There are a bunch of attack vectors like exploiting a
service running as root, exploiting a file that has root access,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;App Hacking:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of fun stuff you can do to hack an Android app. It's
originally coded in Java and although Android runs it's own Java
environment called Dalvik VM, an app can be decompiled from it's byte
code to Java class files. From there you can do some reverse engineering
to take a look at how the app operates. With a little luck and skill,
you can recompile a modified version of the app. I'm not going to go too
deep into this idea but if you're interested, I'll be doing a
presentation at this years &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rochestersecurity.org"&gt;Rochester Security
Summit&lt;/a&gt; that will give you the
tools to do this analysis yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malware:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the security guys now, malware analysis is a fun way to get a peek
into how the bad guys work. Android is in a battle with malware usually
available in alternative markets. Nasty apps like &amp;quot;Nickispy&amp;quot; will steal
your personal information and even record your calls to upload them back
to a server. Some will root your device and install a backdoor like the
latest variant of DroidKungFu. With some tools and some different
analysis techniques, you can perform the analysis yourself. Jason Ross
will also be presenting this year at RSS on this topic if you're
interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardware Hacking:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this years Google IO, they announced the release of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.com/events/io/2011/sessions/android-open-accessory-api-and-development-kit-adk.html"&gt;Android
Development
Kit&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;which
is a bridge between your Android device and your hardware projects.
Imagine controlling an Arduino with a touch screen interface or using
the sensors from your phone to control a robot. As a cheap alternative
to the $300+ kit, Sparkfun has created the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10748"&gt;Android
IOIO&lt;/a&gt;, pronounced yoyo. This
is what my next project will include with a little help from the robot
crew at Interlock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;App Development:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If programming or art is your thing, or you want to make your next
million dollars on an Angry Birds killer, you can get started developing
apps on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://market.android.com/publish"&gt;Android Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;
for $25. This gets you an account to upload your app to the public
directory and it will show up on thousands of people's phones. The
Android SDK along with the Eclipse plugins make it pretty easy to
develop without too much programming knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Android At Interlock:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the coming months, along with all the other changes, we're planning
on doing an Android workshop at the space. Depending on the interest it
may be related to rooting or application development.&lt;/p&gt;

stopped in to make machinable wax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are making Machinable wax is a material that is used on traditional
metalworking machines (Mills, lathes, etc), it is used to test a new
technique or for teaching.&amp;nbsp; The shavings are not sharp, and the
end-product can be melted and reused.&amp;nbsp; When made by us, it is
significantly less expensive then buying metals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be great for practicing with our Sherline Mill, or Craftsman
12&amp;quot; lathe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks Rob!&lt;/p&gt;

The idea is to make a dough like substance that will conduct
electricity. Then you can mold it into interesting shapes and
incorporate electrical components into the sculpture without putting
wires inside. Connecting things does not require using a soldering iron
- you just stick a wire into the dough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the first step is to prepare the dough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_446&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;150&amp;quot; caption=&amp;quot;The

&lt;p&gt;We are making two kinds of dough here - conductive and non-conductive.
The conductive dough will be used for making wires and the
non-conductive dough will separate the conductive pieces so we don't
have a short circuit. The conductive dough is colored with red food
coloring and the non-conductive is left uncolored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conductive dough:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we mix up the non-conductive dough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_456&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;150&amp;quot;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have the dough it is time to experiment. First check to see
if the conductive dough really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_459&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;150&amp;quot;
caption=&amp;quot;What is the resistance?&amp;quot;]&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2011/08/DSC_0163.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image9" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-459" src="/wp-uploads/2011/08/DSC_0163-150x150.jpg" style="width: 150px; height: 150px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resistance was over 40K ohms which seems very high but lets see how
it works. I used 4 AA batteries for power and two LEDs. The pink dough
on one side is ground and the other is +6 volts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_468&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;150&amp;quot; caption=&amp;quot;It
works!!&amp;quot;]&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2011/08/DSC_0171.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image10" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-468" src="/wp-uploads/2011/08/DSC_0171-150x150.jpg" style="width: 150px; height: 150px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it works! Yeah. The LEDs are pretty dim but the are glowing. Trying
different sizes and shapes of dough and some different LEDs we did
manage to get a little better results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_447&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;150&amp;quot;
caption=&amp;quot;Light the Lights&amp;quot;]&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2011/08/DSC_0179.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image11" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-447" src="/wp-uploads/2011/08/DSC_0179-150x150.jpg" style="width: 150px; height: 150px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After seeing our results our taste tester wanted to try something a
little different - he built a battery out of the dough. To make a
battery you several segments or &amp;quot;cells&amp;quot; hooked together in series using
two different metals. Here it was steel staples and copper wires. And
here it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_463&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;200&amp;quot; caption=&amp;quot;One
Volt Battery&amp;quot;]&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2011/08/DSC_0197.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image12" class="size-medium wp-image-463" src="/wp-uploads/2011/08/DSC_0197-200x300.jpg" style="width: 200px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So 6 cells make a 1V battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next experiment will be to try a week later to see if the dough is
still conductive. Also, it will be interesting to see if the
conductivity wears out as it is used. And what happens if we let it dry
out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experiments for another day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Jaimee and Bill for their help with this.&lt;/p&gt;

Technology,&amp;nbsp;I moved out to rural Livingston County; some 30+ miles away
from Interlock and downtown Rochester.&amp;nbsp;Partially because of the distance
to the local repeaters, and partially to impress the ladies,&amp;nbsp;I picked up
an&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.arrowantennas.com/"&gt;Arrow Antenna&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;dual-band
(VHF/UHF) j-pole style antenna&amp;nbsp;from our friend Steve KC2YTC along with a
used 30' antenna mast.&amp;nbsp;Installation entailed mounting the mast to the
side of my house, installing the antenna, soldering the PL-259 connector
to a coax cable (LMR-400 from hamfest) and running it down to my Yaesu
FT-8800 that sits in my office. This ended up being a great little
antenna and now I'm back talking with my friends on the Rochester
repeaters. Special thanks to Chris N2CDO for help soldering the PL-259
connectors on the coax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N0BDW is back on the air!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all you Hams out there, check in to the Monroe County ARES/RACES
net&amp;nbsp;on 146.61 / 444.45 (N2MPE) repeater on Thursday nights at 9pm EST
and you'll likely hear me there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also volunteering with Livonia Fire/EMS, so for the public safety
scanning enthusiasts listen for 298[X] (EMS) or 25[X] (fire) on
Livingston County Fire/EMS dispatch (46.16).&lt;/p&gt;

having previously built the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.paia.com/theremax.asp"&gt;Theremax&lt;/a&gt;, various small things
from
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.vellemanusa.com/us/enu/product/list/?id=523008"&gt;Velleman&lt;/a&gt;,
and, most recently, a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.morsex.com/ameco/oscs.htm"&gt;morse code practice
oscillator&lt;/a&gt;. And, I remember a
place near the central Rochester, NY post office called “&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://rocwiki.org/Rogers_Pianos_and_Clocks"&gt;Rogers
Pianos and Clocks&lt;/a&gt;”
that I have fond memories of visiting and gawking at cool looking
timepieces. So, when I saw the “&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ladyada.net/make/icetube/index.html"&gt;Ice
Tube&lt;/a&gt;” clock kit
from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.adafruit.com/"&gt;Adafruit&lt;/a&gt;, I knew it would be a great
next project. This ATmega-powered clock features a Russian-made IV-18
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_fluorescent_display"&gt;vacuum fluorescent
display&lt;/a&gt;
(VFD) tube, which, despite being blue, like modern, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2005/07/blue-led-backlash.html"&gt;annoying
LEDs&lt;/a&gt;,
is actually really really cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2011/03/2011-03-05_16-55-00_706.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="size-medium wp-image-378 alignright" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2011/03/2011-03-05_16-55-00_706-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;After checking to make sure I had all of the components, I
began the assembly. The first part of the build should be fairly
standard for anyone who has some electronics experience. All you have
to do is assemble a simple regulated 5v power supply. Using the
provided regulator IC, and capacitors to smooth everything out, my 5v
power supply clocked in at 4.99 volts. Not too shabby.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued assembly by adding a single resistor, the piezo speaker, and
finally the ATmega itself (thankfully, Adafruit provided a socket for
all of the ICs, which made the soldering process a lot less stressful!).
At this point, plugging in the power supply resulted in a beep. All is
well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kit, in addition to the ATmega, is driven by a 32.768 khz crystal.
The crystal really does the bulk of the timekeeping by generating a
steady reference frequency for the “ticks”. It was good to see Adafruit
use a crystal for this clock; I think it’s going to stay accurate for a
long time as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it’s time for the fun stuff. Unlike, say, an LCD screen, or some
LEDs, this clock needs around 60 volts to run its vacuum tube properly.
But we’ve only got 5. So, we build a boost converter. After assembly, I
used the multimeter to measure 55.7 vdc across the zener diode. The
kit’s instructions say that anywhere from 40 - 70 is okay, with 60 being
optimal. I’m not thrilled with that number, but it seems like it’s close
enough. We’re working with high voltages here. Since I don’t feel like
taking advantage of Interlock’s insurance policy, I give the capacitors
time to drain, and, as the instructions suggest, do not work on the
circuit until we’re below 15 volts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Th&lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2011/03/2011-03-05_19-20-52_474.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-379" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2011/03/2011-03-05_19-20-52_474-300x224.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;e VFD goes on a smaller PCB, and coaxing it down into
place was a frustrating experience, not unlike wiring an 8P8C ethernet
cable, except bigger, and with a lot more leads. After about 20 minutes
of carefully walking the leads through the holes, I was able to get the
tube in place. I soldered it in, plugged in the other microcontroller
(MAX6921) which actually drives the VFD segments. And... it passed the
smoke test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remainder of the build consisted of putting in a battery backup (in
case mains power is lost), adding a few control switches, and building a
simple, clear case. All in all, it was a fun build, and I feel like my
patience was rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the coming weeks, I plan on building two more clocks of various
types. Check back here for updates!&lt;/p&gt;

Although the parts are designed to be easily cut by hand, I really
wanted an excuse to see some big-ass lasers and to make the acquaintance
of those in charge of said equipment. So off we went. Keep scrolling for
pictures and some commentary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gary – the co-owner of Smidgens, along with his wife Rita – gave us
quite an extensive tour, and answered all of our pesky questions while
we gawked at the machinery. Above, you can see one of their lasers
cutting crane parts out of quarter-inch steel. I was pretty surprised
how quiet the whole operation was, given the amount of cutting going on.
Most of the noise was from the ventilation systems that were constantly
huffing smoke out to the great outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/5333845225/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Overall Shop" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5044/5333845225_5646c6a98a.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 333px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the butt-shot, but here's an overall view of the main space.
There's one more marking laser in another room off to the right, and the
metal-cutting laser is to your left. They also have a bit of storage in
the corner for commonly used materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They had three lasers like the above, and these mostly do wood and
acrylic cutting and etching. I failed to shoot the 8-ish foot long laser
tube, the massive power supply, and the ridiculously beefy stepper
(servo?) motors driving the XY tables. So sorry. It really made the
nerds go all giggity.&lt;/p&gt;

stuff with the lasers that I'm sure their engineers hadn't anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This machine was solely for cutting thin materials or marking things at
an insane speed. Instead of moving the entire workpiece or optics in an
XY fashion, it has two mirrors that remain stationary and just twiddle
the beam to and fro. The design you see above took about ten or fifteen
seconds to cut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here are the parts! Time for assembly... soon enough we'll be
milling circuit boards in-house at Interlock. Thanks again, Gary, for
cutting our parts and taking the time to show us your lasers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wanted to watch a hard drive get shredded in seconds, see
a box of RAM that was 800 pounds, or wander through a 100,000 square
foot grave yard of electronics? So did we, and our tour of Regional
Computer Recycling and Recovery was just that. RCR&amp;amp;R is one of the major
electronics recyclers in the Rochester area, and we were lucky enough to
get a tour of their facilities.&amp;nbsp;They outlined the process from beginning
to end of how a computer is received, processed, parted out, and
eventually recycled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="rotating knives sign" class="photo left" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2010/12/rotatingknivessm-297x300.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of us were guided around the RCR&amp;amp;R facility after learning about
the organization. Vice president Charlie McKernen teamed up with client
service representative Tom Smith to show us the&amp;nbsp;facility, answer our
questions, and keep us on track when our attention strayed to the many
items sitting on the giant shelves.&amp;nbsp;One of the first stops was a hard
drive shredder which chopped through the devices like butter, leaving
just a pile of scraps after a few sparks. We walked by workers parting
out the computers, placing each into a corresponding box that would
eventually be shipped out for recycling by a facility specifically
designed to process that part. Charlie was able to&amp;nbsp;easily&amp;nbsp;answer our
questions on&amp;nbsp;degaussing&amp;nbsp;and secure hard drive&amp;nbsp;wiping&amp;nbsp;methods, and they
all seemed to be up to speed on the latest compliance requirements and
best practices when it came to security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tour&amp;nbsp;happened&amp;nbsp;on the same day that the Democrat and Chronicle
published &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.democratandchronicle.com/article/20101227/NEWS01/12270323/1002/NEWS/Effort-aims-to-cut-waste-electronics"&gt;an
article&lt;/a&gt;
discussing a New York State law touting a state wide, free e-waste
recycling program. Passed in May, the law will make electronics
manufacturers responsible for the waste generated when a computer is
recycled. Current NYS law allows computers to be thrown out as part of
your regular trash, leaking contaminants into the ground.
Hazardous&amp;nbsp;metals like lead and mercury, and the chemicals that make
plastics flame retardant can cause damage to the environment. The new
law aims to get consumers recycling their old electronics by offsetting
the cost back to the manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can visit the RCR&amp;amp;R &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ewaste.com"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; for more
information about their facility and services, and be sure to check out
their &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://stores.ebay.com/Electronics-Cafe"&gt;Electronics Cafe&lt;/a&gt;
eBay store if you're interested in seeing all of the fun stuff they have
for sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Their facility is 100,000 sqft in Victor and their Central Ave.
location is 20,000 sqft.&lt;/p&gt;

this wasn't the original date of our inception, it was the agreed upon
time to meet, discuss what we did the year before, announce plans for
the year after, decide upon the budget, and share ideas that could help
improve Interlock as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first year was packed with tasks necessary for putting together a
hackerspace from the ground up. &amp;nbsp;Starting out, we were a group of people
meeting in a coffee shop with an idea and we quickly transitioned into
getting a space to call home, incorporating the organization and
designing the bylaws for the group. &amp;nbsp;We worked with community leaders to
attend events like Barcamp Rochester and partnered up with our friends
at CoWorking Rochester for lightning talks. And in between all of that,
we tried to make time for our personal projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was fun to hear what members had been working on in the space this
year. Arduinos, Apple 2c+ hacking, knitting, networking, photography,
infosec, robotics, ham radio, makerbot plans, virtualization, lock
picking, phone systems, classes,&amp;nbsp;aerial&amp;nbsp;photography, are just a few of
the projects we worked on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This coming year, we have some exciting new ideas for everyone &amp;nbsp;and the
members have even more ideas for their own projects. &amp;nbsp;Some of those
ideas are about improving Interlock for the public and our community
like offering different membership options. &amp;nbsp;We're also working on ideas
for a project we can work on as a group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally as part of our business planning, we reviewed our financial
situation and approved a budget. &amp;nbsp;You can take a look at our costs and
where the money goes from 2010 below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2010/12/2010_expenses.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Financial numbers for 2010" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-306" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2010/12/2010_expenses-300x124.png" style="width: 300px; height: 124px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A thanks goes out to all of our members and friends who donate their
time, money, and ideas to our cause. &amp;nbsp;We seriously couldn't have done it
without you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are currently VHF/UHF capable using a homemade J-Pole antenna. Our
roof antenna project is progressing nicely and, despite a few snags, the
necessary supplies will soon be ordered in hopes of being functional
before the city experiences any significant snowfall. When all is said
and done, we will have a fairly powerful ham station capable of reaching
the far edges of Monroe County and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upcoming projects include using modified Motorola Bravo pagers for
paging over ham frequencies, and setting up a WinLink node to allow for
e-mailing over ham radio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Labs will be assigned each week and can be completed at home or at the
space. Informal sessions will be held on Thursday nights for those
looking to get more one-on-one time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The supplies needed for this course will include (but are not limited
to) a soldering iron, bread board, resistors, capacitors, and LEDs. A
limited quantity of these items are available at the space, but will
need to be returned and properly sorted when finished. Availability
will, of course, be dependent on attendance. We have also received
offers to borrow larger equipment, such as oscilloscopes, but these are
expensive and in short supply, so please be careful and share
accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the five weeks, we may continue with more in-depth
coverage of specific topics like motor control, sensors, or
microprocessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course is free to all, but donations from non-members are strongly
encouraged and greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="when-and-where"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When And Where&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These classes will take place every Tuesday at 8:00PM from October 12th
until November 9th. For further information or to get directions to the
space, please visit the

&lt;p&gt;Two long weeks ago, we finally scrounged the equipment and ingredients
necessary to iterate &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.hackpittsburgh.org/brewing-open-mate-soda"&gt;Hack Pittsburgh's Open Mate

Personally, I hadn't heard of this odd &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club-Mate"&gt;Club
Mate&lt;/a&gt; beverage until I saw
the recipe, but -- being a homebrewer -- I couldn't help but to order a
case (for comparison purposes only, of course) and hunt down some &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerba_mat%C3%A9"&gt;yerba
maté&lt;/a&gt; and caffeine
powder of my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With said ingredients in hand, we put three gallons of water on the hot
plate during one of our Tuesday open nights (come visit!), and proceeded
to spend three hours hovering around the kitchen area, waiting for it to
get anywhere near boiling. The tea was brewed, sugared, cooled, and
kegged with the following specifications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ingredients"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 gallons of water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3oz yerba mate tea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2c sugar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;juice of 0.5 lemons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0.5t citric acid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="procedure"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Procedure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bring water to just under a boil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add tea to water (I put the tea in a big homebrewing grain bag,
effectively creating a huge teabag)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;steep for six minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remove tea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add sugar, lemon juice, citric acid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cool, pour into a keg, carbonate at 20psi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll notice we skipped the caffeine this time. Personally, I'm more
concerned with flavor than (added) stimulants, so I never bothered
tracking down a scale sensitive enough to measure out one or two grams
of powder. Feel free to add that in when you're adding the sugar (check
out &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.hackpittsburgh.org/brewing-open-mate-soda"&gt;Hack Pittsburgh's
recipe&lt;/a&gt; for the
correct measurements and warnings).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="yum"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yum?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We finally got to do some beta tasting this past Thursday, and all
testers agreed that it was yummy and pretty faithful to the original
product. I have since sat down for a more in-depth side-by-side
comparison (not double-blinded, mind you), and I feel our recipe --
although quite tasty -- has come up a bit short compared to the real
deal. The sweetness is spot on, but there is a complexity and depth to
the tea flavor that is missing in our beverage. So I think we'll try
some things differently next time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;adding lemon was a mistake: I was hoping to avoid uncommon
ingredients like citric acid, but alas, you should go out and get
some (cream of tartar was a pretty popular substitute in old-timey
ginger beer recipes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more citric acid: fizzy tea is pretty dull without a bit of acid
zing. We should probably at least double it next time, but further
experimentation is in order&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;increase the tea input: I'm hoping part of the depth-of-flavor
difference is merely a matter of strength&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;caramelize some of the sugar first: Club Mate has added coloring.
Hopefully caramelizing some of the sugar will make Open Mate less
pale, and also improve flavor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any other ideas? I can't wait to work through our first three gallons,
so we can start brewing the next version. Bottoms up!&lt;/p&gt;

random subject they've just learned. The talks showed the range of
knowledge of Interlock from artificial intellegence, soldering, art
history, orienteering, making booklets, cross site scripting attacks,
the board game go, IRSSI, cat5 cables, learning how to program, things
going on at RIT, guest wireless access points, offsite backup solutions,
and 3D molecule rendering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you've never heard of the idea, it's easy. You make a presentation
but it's only 5 minutes long. We'd like to have everyone involved. The
more presentations we have the better. The only rules is, you have 5
minutes and you will be timed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're not a member, we want you to come and you can even do a talk
or just sit back and be entertained.&amp;nbsp; Anyone that would like to be added
to the list can email antitree at interlock roc dot org.&lt;/p&gt;
