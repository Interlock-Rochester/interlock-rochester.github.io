Defined Radio (SDR)
workshop&lt;/a&gt;.
The goal of which is to provide introductory support to people learning
about SDR's as well as let some of the more seasoned folk work on their
projects. We've talk to a lot of people lately about what an SDR is and
why we have a workshop for it so I thought&amp;nbsp;I'd review why they're fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is an SDR?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike some&amp;nbsp;radio equipment which only provides a small range of
frequencies you can transmit and receive on, SDR's&amp;nbsp;let you use&amp;nbsp;a single
device, and control their frequency from very low (&amp;lt;100Mhz) to very high
(2.4GHz+).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2015/02/hdsdr11.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="hdsdr1[1]" class="size-medium wp-image-1902 aligncenter" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2015/02/hdsdr11-300x169.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 169px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past,&amp;nbsp;if you wanted to listen in on a certain frequency, say your
garage door opener for example, you'd have to buy a piece of hardware
that runs at that frequency -- in this case it's often 434MHz. Now for
as little as $20, you can buy a device that can read your &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rtl-sdr.com/using-rtl-sdr-ti-chronos-rf-wristwatch-copy-garage-door-opener/"&gt;garage door
opener at
433Mhz&lt;/a&gt;,
listen to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rtl-sdr.com/video-tutorial-hak5-gnu-radio-fm-radio-receiver/"&gt;local FM radio
station&lt;/a&gt;
at 90.5Mhz, or &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rtl-sdr.com/adsb-aircraft-radar-with-rtl-sdr/"&gt;track airplanes at
1090Mhz&lt;/a&gt;.
This lets you play with different frequencies and see what's being
transmitted. You may be surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also lets you learn about the basics of RF: electronics,
antennas,&amp;nbsp;ways to decode a signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workshop is open to the public; non-members are welcome as
always.&amp;nbsp;Feel free to drop a comment on the meetup page if&amp;nbsp;you're
interested but have some questions.&lt;/p&gt;

weekly electronics course with instructor Carl Schmidtmann. This is a
five week class that is open to members and non-members alike, and will
provide attendees with an introduction to basic electronic components
and circuits, as well as the tools and instruments used to build and
test them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-to-expect"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What To Expect&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this course you should be able to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify common components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read a schematic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build basic circuit board projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design your own circuits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labs will be assigned each week and can be completed at home or at the
space. Informal sessions will be held on Thursday nights for those
looking to get more one-on-one time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The supplies needed for this course will include (but are not limited
to) a soldering iron, bread board, resistors, capacitors, and LEDs. A
limited quantity of these items are available at the space, but will
need to be returned and properly sorted when finished. Availability
will, of course, be dependent on attendance. We have also received
offers to borrow larger equipment, such as oscilloscopes, but these are
expensive and in short supply, so please be careful and share
accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the five weeks, we may continue with more in-depth
coverage of specific topics like motor control, sensors, or
microprocessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course is free to all, but donations from non-members are strongly
encouraged and greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="when-and-where"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When And Where&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These classes will take place every Tuesday at 8:00PM from October 12th
until November 9th. For further information or to get directions to the
space, please visit the

&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Processing to create basic software applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make your own drawing and animation tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a GUI (Graphical User Interface) to control your software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use an Arduino to provide physical controls for your drawing and
animation tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'd like to find out how many people are coming so if you're
interested, please sign up on our Meetup.com page:
