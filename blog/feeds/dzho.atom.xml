into your ssh client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier, these pages addressed this problem &lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}/raspberry-pi-macgyver.rst"&gt;using VNC to provide a
remote Raspberry Pi
display&lt;/a&gt;
(eg, from your laptop).&amp;nbsp; It's a good approach, well documented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternately, with a little bit of prep work, perhaps using the above
technique to get everything set up to start, you can program your Pi to
announce its IP address via audio using text-to-speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_1665&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot;
width=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot;]&lt;img alt="earbuds" class="wp-image-1665 size-medium" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2014/06/earbuds-300x225.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 225px;" /&gt; Much cheaper output than a HDMI-capable
monitor[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essence of this trick is to install a text-to-speech program, create
a small script to extract the IP address, to pass that address to the
text-to-speech program, and then finally to configure the initialization
scripts to run the readout script shortly after booting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm working with a rev B Raspberry Pi running Raspbian, but the approach
should be generalizable to any distro for which a TTS package is
available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, set up the Raspberry Pi with keyboard, mouse, wired networking,
and video, either HDMI or analog.&amp;nbsp; If you use analog, you may need to
increase the font size considerably even to be able to read the screen.
Open a terminal and install festival:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;sudo &lt;span class="pre"&gt;apt-get&lt;/span&gt; install festival&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, if you haven't already done so, create a &lt;strong&gt;bin&lt;/strong&gt; directory in your
home directory to hold this and other small local scripts and programs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;mkdir ~/bin&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, open your favorite editor to create a small script file containing
the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`` #!/usr/bin/bash /usr/bin/amixer cset numid=3 1 /sbin/ifconfig | /bin/grep -A3 eth0 | /bin/grep inet | /usr/bin/tr ':' ' ' | /usr/bin/cut -d-f 13 | /usr/bin/festival --tts``&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be careful if you try to copy-and-paste that that a) you get the
single-quotes carried over into the right place and b) that you don't
have any space or tab or other otherwise hard-to-see non-newline
whitespace characters at the end of the lines with backslashes. If
either error crops up, edit to fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(NB: ifconfig is a bit old school. Interlock HAM and rally enthusiast
HoopyCat points out that to be fully kids-these-days compliant, one
should use the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;ip&lt;/tt&gt; command.)*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save the file as &lt;strong&gt;/home/pi/bin/ippixvox.sh&lt;/strong&gt; and give it execute
permissions with &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;chmod a+x /home/pi/bin/ippixvox.sh&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;You can now test it by typing&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;`` ~/bin/ippivox.sh``&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;into your terminal with a speaker or earphones plugged in. If you are
connected to a network (and if not, how did you get festival
downloaded?) you should hear the IPv4 address read off. If not, run
ifconfig to check to make sure you do have IPv4 address (&amp;quot;inet&amp;quot;)
assigned, and that it is assigned to eth0. If it's assigned to something
other than eth0, modify the script above to suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Finally, to make this work at boot time, open the file&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;**
/etc/init.d/rc.local**&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in an editor and add at the very bottom this one line&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;/home/pi/bin/ippivox.sh&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save, reboot, and listen for the IP address to be read to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it works, then you can dispense with attaching a video output device
when it comes time to hack on the Pi in favor of just logging in from a
machine elsewhere on the same network using ssh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it useful to play a short alert announcement before the IP
address is read. I also use a second TTS program, flite, both to give me
a second shot at hearing the IP and also in hopes that I'll be better
able to understand at least one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My more lengthy approach to this is documented in the following github
gist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/deejoe/ce7984f94b91bdb6b48e"&gt;https://gist.github.com/deejoe/ce7984f94b91bdb6b48e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Friday[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We shared that portion of the first floor with some folks from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.team340.org/"&gt;Greater
Rochester Robotics&lt;/a&gt;, who brought the robot
from their most recent FIRST Robotics Competition season, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc/2013-game"&gt;Ultimate
Ascent.&lt;/a&gt; They
were letting visitors move the robot around the floor and occasionally
launch a plastic flying disk or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn't quite the battle of the bots, but a couple of times the 'bot
got up a good head start and whacked into the front of our table,
sloshing around the water in the PCL crock and the regatta box. Midway
through, such a collision &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; have had a role to play in loosening
up the Huxley's X-axis drive gear (now since fixed), at which point we
switched from printing in silver-gray PLA (polylactic acid) on the
Huxley to printing in fluorescent yellow ABS
(acrylonitrile/butadiene/styrene) on the MacGyverbot. This led us to
discover that kids love them some bright plastic sharks.&lt;/p&gt;

Rochester&lt;/a&gt; for helping us get
started by offering space and moral support during some of our bigger
early organizational meetings, before we settled on a space of our own
to rent. Still, it's interesting to see people coming together in
another coworking space in town, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://smokestackcowork.com/"&gt;Smokestack

&lt;p&gt;Here's hoping they both thrive and complement each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Ithaca Generator logo" src="/wp-uploads/2013/02/robotic-logo-like2.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month we received a visitor from Ithaca, José, who traveled up with
a couple of friends maybe to join what he thought at the time was the
closest hackerspace to him. I had a great time talking with him, so it
was a little bittersweet to tell him &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ithacagenerator.org/"&gt;Ithaca
Generator&lt;/a&gt; has recently gotten off to
what looks like a good start and might just meet his needs without the
long drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I wasn't able to make it to their &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ithacagenerator.org/events/open-house/"&gt;open
house&lt;/a&gt; back in
December. But, I&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;did visit with some family over the holidays who were able to go and
got to see the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.evilmadscientist.com/2008/edge-lit-holiday-cards/"&gt;party
favors&lt;/a&gt;
they made at the open house. Fun. Look like good things are in store
for the hands-on, DIY hacker and maker community in Ithaca.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Buffalo Labs logo" src="/wp-uploads/2013/02/buffalo-lab.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also been having a friend, Joe, make the trip from Niagara Falls
every so often to visit, which has had us asking how things are going at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.buffalolab.org/blog/"&gt;Buffalo Lab&lt;/a&gt;. Figured we've give
them a shout out while we're at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[placehold for eventual &lt;strong&gt;Rochester Makerspace&lt;/strong&gt; logo]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, but hopefully not least, the most recent big news is a
much-anticipated step for the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rochestermakerspace.org/"&gt;group&lt;/a&gt; calling themselves
Rochester Makerspace. They've rented a space a little north of downtown,
on St. Paul Street. Just Tuesday they had &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rochestermakerspace.org/tuesday-meeting-reminder-pizza-0205/"&gt;a get-together with
pizza&lt;/a&gt;
at the new location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the planning for this new space has been careful and deliberate,
ongoing since at least this last summer, they now are moving towards
ambitious goals to grow fast. I continue eagerly to await the opening of
another maker-friendly space in Rochester, expected some time in March.&lt;/p&gt;

tschotskes that speak to our interests. This doesn't get us closer to
the glorious future of 3D printers for everyone, but I like to think of
it as our answer to Wall Street's &amp;quot;profit taking&amp;quot;: Every once in a while
it's nice to just cash out a little bit and enjoy what you've already
got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My turn at that most recently was this little model of monomeric
insulin, based on the crystal structure reported by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1504238"&gt;Gursky et.
al.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick is how to take a computer model of something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="9ins solvent-accessible surface Z rotation" src="http://deejoe.etrumeus.com/interlock/9ins/9ins.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and print it on the 3D printer so that it goes from being an
on-the-screen abstraction to something you can hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider that there are many different ways to render these things on a
screen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/05/montage2.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-928" src="/wp-uploads/2012/05/montage2.png" style="width: 576px; height: 567px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each has its uses. But learning how to manipulate an on-screen rendering
can be a fraught experience. How much better, then, to have the option
of turning the model over directly, with your own hands?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With fused deposition printing, the problem is that the irregular
surface doesn't really present a good way of getting the nascent object
to stick to the print bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start, I trolled through the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rcsb.org"&gt;RCSB&lt;/a&gt; web site
for a suitable small globular protein that had a bit of name
recognition. I picked
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"&gt;insulin&lt;/a&gt;, and from among the
various insulin entries, picked
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=9ins"&gt;9INS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I brought that file up in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pymol.org"&gt;PyMOL&lt;/a&gt;, issued &amp;quot;hide
everything&amp;quot; and then &amp;quot;show surface&amp;quot; (or their GUI equivalents) and, with
a few other visual tweaks, like setting the color, exported a VRML 2
(.wrl) file. I played around with that in meshlab a bit, exporting it
then as an .stl file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally sorted out that what I really needed to do was bring it into
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.blender.org"&gt;Blender&lt;/a&gt; and subtract a cube-shaped (well,
any volume with a flat face would probably do) volume from the molecule
to give a partial rendering of the model with a flat surface. Doing that
twice, to generate each &amp;quot;half&amp;quot; of the molecule, leaves me with two .stl
files that can be printed flat side down. In some cases, I've brought
the file into &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://cloud.netfabb.com"&gt;netfabb's online service&lt;/a&gt;
for cleanup of manifold errors. Then, I bring each file into
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://replicat.org"&gt;ReplicatorG&lt;/a&gt; to more easily scale and orient
the model. Finally, I bring the .stl files into
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://slic3r.org"&gt;Slic3r&lt;/a&gt; to generate the .g file for taking over
to the printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/05/IMG_4786.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-889" src="/wp-uploads/2012/05/IMG_4786-300x225.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 225px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This result is a fairly small protein and a fairly small model that was
fast to design and print as a proof of concept. Future challenges will
be to find ways of dividing up larger models and of larger molecules or
multi-molecule assemblies so they can be printed, perhaps printing
different chains in different colors, preserving relative scaling
between different components and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12283"&gt;There&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:18928"&gt;are&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3511"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:19989"&gt;at&lt;/a&gt;

suppose those that have them might post them later--but in the meantime
I figured I'd give a quick recap of my experience at our open house
Friday, before it fades too much further from active memory into the
realm of myth and legend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was, in short, a great time.&amp;nbsp; We had a fairly good variety of folks
wander through, from pre-teens on up.&amp;nbsp; I spent a while fishing out from
a small water-filled [STRIKEOUT:crockpot] slow cooker &lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}/dashing-through-the-thermoplastic-2.rst"&gt;fun little blobs
of warm
polycaprolactone&lt;/a&gt;
These I then shoved into the hands of anyone who would take them as they
wandered through our conference/presentation/meeting room. It was great
seeing folks' reaction to its warm, pliable nature and to listen to them
comment about how tough and rigid it is once cooled.&amp;nbsp; It's a very
minimalistic but (at least I'd like to think) very representative
demonstration of the interactive, collaborative, exploratory,&amp;nbsp; hand's-on
environment we try to provide at Interlock to members and guests alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a bit of a break from running my mouth and from noodling around
in the hot water and gooey PCL&amp;nbsp; to watch&amp;nbsp; a short but sweet
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://toool.us/"&gt;TOOOL&lt;/a&gt;-designed lockpicking slideshow, followed by
a lockpicking workshop.
&lt;a class="reference external" href="/author/antitree.html"&gt;Antitree&lt;/a&gt; had done the
pied-piper trick, drawing a bunch of kids-in-fact and kids-at-heart into
the conference room for a short statement of the lock picking rules, a
little bit of lock construction and mechanism theory and picking
how-to.&amp;nbsp; Then everyone took turns with the several sets of lock picking
tools and real locksets for some hand's-on experience.&amp;nbsp; Folks really
seemed to have a good time with trying it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in the space, all the folks &lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}/open-house-new-space.rst"&gt;originally promised to
appear&lt;/a&gt; were
around.&amp;nbsp; I can only guess at how awesome their presentations were, but
there seemed to be people everywhere.&amp;nbsp; Early on, I was worried no one
would make it into the not-a-kitchen for snacks, but that turned out to
be not-a-problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure how much of the traffic was driven by word-of-mouth versus
posted fliers, but I know at least some folks had seen our &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rochestercitynewspaper.com/entertainment/pop-culture/2012/03/The-gee+k-guide-to-Rochester/"&gt;lead-off
part in a feature in the independent weekly tabloid Rochester City
Newspaper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lead-up to the open house rekindled a fire under some of our 3D
printing aspirations.&amp;nbsp; I don't want to give too much away there, but
that's been bubbling along these last few weeks.&amp;nbsp; And, in addition to
folks who made it on Friday, we've also been having new folks continue
to come in for our weekly Open Night.&amp;nbsp; This week, we met John, who
brought us some fun new-to-us toys (again, perhaps more on that later,
but in the meantime, thanks, John!).&amp;nbsp; Also, we got to meet and talk to
(a different, distinct) Joe and Andrew.&amp;nbsp; And so it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you came to visit us Friday, we hope you liked what you saw and will
come back.&amp;nbsp; If you missed it, not to worry:&amp;nbsp; Please keep an eye on our
calendar for other events (at least two every week).&amp;nbsp; Or, if you can't
make it then, drop us a line and maybe we can work out an appointment
for some other time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way I kept on an even keel during the recent holiday season was by
taking every opportunity I could to practice making these &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.en.origami-club.com/fun/balloon/ballon/index.html"&gt;origami
cubical
&amp;quot;balloons&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;
using scraps of wrapping paper. I made in excess of a dozen, and that
was the high point of my recent kick to practice enough to be able to do
this pattern from memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a maker-theory perspective, even with the digital revolution and
the move to e-texts to replace things, like books, that have
traditionally used paper, paper as a material is still ubiquitous and
cheap. Its ready availability means that one can cultivate the maker
state of mind just about any where--I started out on this recent origami
journey after lunch one day a couple of months ago, using the
coated-paper basket liner at a burrito place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paper fast-food tray liners and place mats do pretty well in a pinch,
and making something then and there is a great way to entertain a
youngster or to open a discussion with an indulgent friend, co-worker,
or even a stranger, about the fun to be had as a hacker and maker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amongst different types of paper, paper sold as &amp;quot;origami paper&amp;quot; can be a
little more hard to find and more expensive. I also try to resist that
tendency projects have to lead off with &amp;quot;first, go out and buy
something&amp;quot;. So I set out to figure out &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://deejoe.posterous.com/recycled-paper-origami"&gt;a way consistently to convert
randomly-shaped scraps of
paper&lt;/a&gt; into
squares suitable for use with traditional origami patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, at my last turn on door duty for Interlock's &amp;quot;Do Night&amp;quot; I
worked on expanding my repertoire a little bit, learning how to make
these
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.en.origami-club.com/traditional/box2/box2/index.html"&gt;open-topped&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.en.origami-club.com/traditional/candybox/candybox/index.html"&gt;boxes.&lt;/a&gt;
Also, Reggie was a pretty ggod sport about taking some instruction from
me about how to fold up his own balloon made from wrapping paper I
pushed on him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I'm not that enthused about making little animals. Also, I had
my paper airplane phase as a kid, so that doesn't hold a lot of appeal
for me at the moment. Mostly, pure geometry, as in the balloon-cubes,
and potentially useful knick-knacks, like the candy box, are what I've
been after. With the holidays gone, my interest may fade for a bit.
We'll see.&lt;/p&gt;

messing with long strings of electrical wire, crazy light bulbs, and
LEDs plus all sorts of weird objects made of ceramic, glass, metal or
plastic. I was inspired to offset some of my Grinchiness by using our
put-up-the-decorations day as another opportunity to use one of my new
favorite materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Christmas tree stand has this nifty tiered collection of what are,
essentially, big set screws, designed to hold the trunk of the tree
upright in the center of the tree stand. Problem is, over time we've
lost the little plastic caps from the trunk end of several of the set
screws. This means the set screws tear up the bark of the tree trunk
more quickly, and dig more easily into the trunk of the tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That can't be good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" src="http://deejoe.etrumeus.com/interlock/PCL-tree-stand/10-PCL-tree-stand-missing-caps-sxga.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, another of our tree stands, smaller, with only one tier of set
screws, has a nice little conical stand-off built into the bottom of the
stand, to help keep the bottom of the tree off the bottom of the stand.
That way water can get into the bottom and up through the tree. The
larger stand that we like to use, with two tiers of set screws, has no
such stand-off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I made little caps out of
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycaprolactone"&gt;PCL&lt;/a&gt;
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://reprap.org/wiki/Polycaprolactone"&gt;polycaprolactone&lt;/a&gt;, aka
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.makershed.com/product_p/mkshl1.htm"&gt;Shapelock&lt;/a&gt; aka

Plastic&lt;/a&gt;,
about which perhaps more some other time) to replace the missing ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" src="http://deejoe.etrumeus.com/interlock/PCL-tree-stand/25-PCL-tree-stand-old-and-new-caps-sxga.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a mold out of some &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer_clay"&gt;polymer
clay&lt;/a&gt; using the OEM green
cap and made one PCL cap with the mold. Using polymer clay this way is
something I've been meaning to try. Sad to say, that approach still
needs a little work--I had a lot of trouble with the PCL locking into
small imperfections in the mold. The rest of the replacement caps I made
by just pressing warm PCL around the ends of the set screws, free form,
and then letting them cool and harden in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also made a little PCL stand-off to put in the bottom of the tree,
with a little &amp;quot;spider&amp;quot; consisting of two crossed PCL rods to help keep
it near the center of the bottom of the well of the stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" src="http://deejoe.etrumeus.com/interlock/PCL-tree-stand/30-PCL-tree-stand-standoff-sxga.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here they are, all together:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" src="http://deejoe.etrumeus.com/interlock/PCL-tree-stand/40-PCL-tree-stand-with-new-parts-sxga.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The caps seem to have worked pretty well. The spider kept slipping out
of place as I was trying to get the stand fit onto the tree. Next year
maybe I'll try putting something soft and sticky on the ends to help
with more of a press-fit, either some sort of generic silicone caulk or
some &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sugru.com/"&gt;Sugru&lt;/a&gt; or something.&lt;/p&gt;
