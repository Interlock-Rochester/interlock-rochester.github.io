our club antennas.&amp;nbsp; Bill is an expert user on several digital
communications modes including PSK31.&amp;nbsp; PSK31 or &amp;quot;Phase Shift Keying, 31
Baud&amp;quot; is a digital radio modulation mode, used primarily in the amateur
radio field to conduct real-time keyboard-to-keyboard informal text chat
between amateur radio operators.&amp;nbsp; After we got his rig set up and
interfaced to Ham Radio Deluxe running on the club computer, we started
a session on 40 meters and keyboard chatted with a guy in Spain.&amp;nbsp; We
also chatted with a Ham in Wisconsin and another in Alabama.&amp;nbsp; We heard a
Russian station but not quite enough signal to get to him with 50
watts.&amp;nbsp; Here’s a link to a wiki
on&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSK31"&gt;PSK31:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also got an old Radio Shack HTX-202 operating APRS (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.aprs.org/"&gt;Automatic Packet
Reporting System&lt;/a&gt;) with
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ui-view.org/"&gt;UI-View32&lt;/a&gt; (an ancient client software for
radio packet hosting) and the ProComm TNC to communicate to the radio.
K2HAX is on the map!&amp;nbsp; APRS is an important tool for position reporting,
remote telemetry, text messaging anyone anyplace, and local coordination
of emergency training events. For a cool view of current APRS activity
around K2HAX, go &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://aprs.fi/?call=K2HAX&amp;amp;others=1"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

access to the roof.&amp;nbsp; On a beautiful fall day, Chris Olin and I put up a
30’ fiberglass mast on a tripod base (not attached to the roof).&amp;nbsp; Then
we hoisted up a trapped dipole for 10-80 meters and a G5RV.&amp;nbsp; The dipole
is oriented SW-NE, the G5RV is SE-NW.&amp;nbsp; We also put up a 2m/70 cm J-Pole
for VHF/UHF.&amp;nbsp; All the feedlines were run with previously used 8/U down
to our space (about 150’) and into the Ham Shack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We initially had a Kenwood TS-530s transceiver and roller tuner setup
for HF and we made a few contacts.&amp;nbsp; We wanted to get the Yaesu FT-857GX
out of the storage container and try it out.&amp;nbsp; That is setup now along
with an automatic tuner.&amp;nbsp; Reception seems decent.&amp;nbsp; We are waiting on an
operable microphone to get back on the air.&amp;nbsp; Bill, Von, Rowan, and Steve
are working on that.&amp;nbsp; We will be working on CAT control and a hook-up
for using SDR like functionality with Ham Radio Deluxe, allowing us to
get into the digital communication modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Yaesu FT-8800 VHF/UHF rig is working well, K2HAX normally monitors
146.61 (N2MPE local ARES/RACES repeater) while someone is in the shack.
We have cables for programming this rig on order and also have a cable
for use with the PacComm TNC for packet, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have a desktop PC with a nice monitor setup for use with the
transceivers.&amp;nbsp; We are waiting on a 2 port serial card to communicate
with the radios.&amp;nbsp; The remote programming of the radios and the option
for digital mode communications (PSK, Packet, etc) opens up with the PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our bench includes power supplies, frequency counters, various
multi-meters and hand tools.&amp;nbsp; We have a great selection of soldering
tools for discrete and SMT component work.&amp;nbsp; We have a variable
temperature iron and a variable speed and temperature blower for
re-work.&amp;nbsp; On order is a Hakko 808 de-soldering tool.&amp;nbsp; We have 2 antenna
analyzers, a new Comet and an older MFJ.&amp;nbsp; Several bench projects are
already underway including Jamie’s whispering clocks, many cable hacks
for the radios, and Walter’s attempts to repair blown audio equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ham radio is witnessing a rebirth in popularity.&amp;nbsp; Emergency preparedness
at the county/state/and national level has recognized the value of Ham
radio as the most dependable means for communication during an
emergency.&amp;nbsp; Interlock members have participated in local POD drills,
Ginna nuclear event practice response teams and are regular attendees at
the local ARES/RACES meetings.&amp;nbsp; Ham Radio can provide texting, TV and
many other familiar forms of communication without any annoying
infrastructure.&amp;nbsp; We can DX with Ham operators around the world, by voice
and many new and old digital modes.&amp;nbsp; SDR is an emerging technology
applied to Ham radio; opening up some fantastic possibilities for low
power operation, contesting, and pulling weak signals out of the noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ham radio is growing in popularity.&amp;nbsp; Interlock Hams would love to
introduce anyone interested to the hobby and answer any questions you
may have.&lt;/p&gt;
