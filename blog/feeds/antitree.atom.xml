&lt;p&gt;This coming Tuesday, we'll be holding a website hackathon to get
people into web technologies and discuss various different architectures.
The idea will be that we'll discuss different types of technologies
and ways of hosting the website so that no only do we up-date our
own page, but we'll show you how to update yours as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our design goals are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FOSS Friendly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distributed responsibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe not in that order.&lt;/p&gt;

that gives the BBB a pretty&amp;nbsp;useful feature; charging and operating off
of li-po batteries.&amp;nbsp;If you look at the BBB board, you will see 4
through-holes behind the 5v plug. These are break outs for the PMIC and
can be used to&amp;nbsp;hook up to a battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2015/03/IMAG0734.jpg.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img alt="beaglebone with sparkfun battery" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1906" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2015/03/IMAG0734.jpg-300x170.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 170px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a battery connected to your board gives you the ability to do
things like making a UPS for you beaglebone so in the case of a power
loss, it can politely shut-down, run a custom command, or just continue
running for as long as the battery can charge it.&lt;img alt="bbb_pinouts" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1907" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2015/03/bbb_pinouts-e1425329803523-267x300.jpg" style="width: 267px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="power"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most of the use cases, you're going to find a lithium&amp;nbsp;polymer that
can produce around 3.7V which is under the BBB's 5v requirement. 3.7V
will work fine to power the board but of course your 5V USB port will
not work while on the
battery.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8483"&gt;Sparkfun&lt;/a&gt;has a
few nice ones that have the voltage protection circuits built in&amp;nbsp;to help
limit the risk you brick your li-po.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="configuration"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 4 pins we're talking about:&lt;strong&gt;|bbb-batt-srm|&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TP5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TP6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TP7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TP8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see in the diagram what each pin-out is. Li-po's are riskier
than some batteries because they're&amp;nbsp;known to explode&amp;nbsp;in some cases of
over powering. A temperature sensor that is designed to check how hot
the battery is getting and decide how to handle it, is built into the
PMIC in case your battery doesn't have this capability already(many do).
The directions below are going to show you how to jump this temperatur
check with a 10k resistor, which is not recommended if you value your
home or hackerspace. If you don't trust the battery you're charging, I'd
suggest looking into accurately reading the temperature from your
battery. My Sparkfun batteries do no break out the temperature sensor so
this wasn't plausible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="directions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Directions&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jumper pins TP5 to TP6 (or use an SMT zero ohm resistor)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;connect a 10K resistor between TP7 and TP8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install a JST connector on TP6 and TP8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connect your battery into the JST connector&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a little luck and the correct battery, you should be in business.
You'll need to let your battery charge before you try and yank the power
cable from it. In the mean time, you can query the status of the battery
via the i2cget command built into the OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="testing"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PMIC is accessible using I2C and the builti-n OS for BBB has a
simple command line interface to query its state. The following command
will tell you whether or not battery is plugged in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`` i2cget -y -f 0 0x24 0xA``&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will return information that contains this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
0 device 0x24
On battery power only? 0
STATUS: r[0xa]=0x88
Push Button = 0
USB Power = 0
AC Power = 1
CHARGER: r[0x3]=0x1
Active (charging) = 1
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Active&amp;quot; refers to whether it can recognize the battery you have plugged
in. &amp;nbsp;You can also read this state to detect a power failure and
automatically failover. If you're using the default OS for the
Beaglebone Black (the one that comes pre-installed), the OS will
automatically shut itself down in the case of a power loss. You'll want
to either install another OS, or disable that service if you'd like to
change how long the battery should stay online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="more-info"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More info&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decent amount of research went into this simple project. There are a
ton of warnings and caveats that I'm not going to cram into this blog
post (i2c address is read only, pin-outs are not a standard size, beware
of jumping the resistor next to the pins). You can find out more
information here:&lt;/p&gt;

Defined Radio (SDR)
workshop&lt;/a&gt;.
The goal of which is to provide introductory support to people learning
about SDR's as well as let some of the more seasoned folk work on their
projects. We've talk to a lot of people lately about what an SDR is and
why we have a workshop for it so I thought&amp;nbsp;I'd review why they're fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is an SDR?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike some&amp;nbsp;radio equipment which only provides a small range of
frequencies you can transmit and receive on, SDR's&amp;nbsp;let you use&amp;nbsp;a single
device, and control their frequency from very low (&amp;lt;100Mhz) to very high
(2.4GHz+).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2015/02/hdsdr11.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="hdsdr1[1]" class="size-medium wp-image-1902 aligncenter" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2015/02/hdsdr11-300x169.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 169px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past,&amp;nbsp;if you wanted to listen in on a certain frequency, say your
garage door opener for example, you'd have to buy a piece of hardware
that runs at that frequency -- in this case it's often 434MHz. Now for
as little as $20, you can buy a device that can read your &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rtl-sdr.com/using-rtl-sdr-ti-chronos-rf-wristwatch-copy-garage-door-opener/"&gt;garage door
opener at
433Mhz&lt;/a&gt;,
listen to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rtl-sdr.com/video-tutorial-hak5-gnu-radio-fm-radio-receiver/"&gt;local FM radio
station&lt;/a&gt;
at 90.5Mhz, or &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rtl-sdr.com/adsb-aircraft-radar-with-rtl-sdr/"&gt;track airplanes at
1090Mhz&lt;/a&gt;.
This lets you play with different frequencies and see what's being
transmitted. You may be surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also lets you learn about the basics of RF: electronics,
antennas,&amp;nbsp;ways to decode a signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workshop is open to the public; non-members are welcome as
always.&amp;nbsp;Feel free to drop a comment on the meetup page if&amp;nbsp;you're
interested but have some questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/10/1550_LRG-600x4611.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="http://www.adafruit.com/blog/2013/10/04/new-product-grand-ideas-studio-jtagulator/" class="aligncenter" src="/wp-uploads/2013/10/1550_LRG-600x4611.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 461px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="section" id="jtag"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JTAG&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) is just a name for a standard way of
providing a debug interface to your hardware devices. What's nice about
it is with one interface, you can provide debugging capabilities to a
variety of chips on your board. So if you have two microcontrollers,
each of them can be separately accessed through one interface. Pretty
cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hackers have been using JTAG for years to reverse hardware. You might
have seen them used when messing with router firmware to install DD-WRT
or OpenWRT. For WRT supported routers, JTAG often gives you the ability
to push a custom firmware onto a board or extra the firmware that is
currently installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="jtag-for-security"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JTAG For Security&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course with all of my projects, I add a security twist. JTAG lets me
gain low level access to a device and see how it works. An interface may
be able to dump an EEPROM which could contain the cryptographic keys
that are securing another piece of memory on the chip. Or it could give
me a serial console similar to a root terminal that lets me interact
with a device like a computer. The point is, it's a debuggable interface
that I can use to exploit in a variety of ways to learn about how the
device works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might wonder why these interfaces even exist on hardware since they
give hackers the opportunity to access your hardware. Because JTAG is so
useful for debugging, manufacturers actually use this interface the same
way you would, to make sure the device is functioning properly. That's
why it's highly likely you'll find some kind of debug interface for your
boards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="jtagulator-setup"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JTAGulator Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JTAGulator connects to your computer using a micro-USB cable that
shows up as a serial device. In Linux, that device will be something
like /dev/ttyUSB0. It uses 115.2K baud 8N1. Once connected using
something like minicom or gtkterm in Linux, you'll see a prompt of
available options. You can now start JTAGulating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To connect the JTAGulator to a device, the board is designed to use the
cables from a standard Bus Pirate board. You can either do that, or just
use some aligator clips to connect to the pins. Either way, the board
you're working on is going to need to be have the JTAG leads broken out
so you can connect something to them. In my little Asus router that I
found, these pins are pretty easy to access. I just soldered some cables
on to them, and added a bit of glue to make sure they kept. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_1527&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;225&amp;quot;]&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2013/10/IMG_20131015_1929571.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Asus Router with wires near JTAG leads" class="size-medium wp-image-1527" src="/wp-uploads/2013/10/IMG_20131015_1929571-225x300.jpg" style="width: 225px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Asus Router with wires near JTAG
leads[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this point, your router should be connected to the JTAGulator, your
JTAGulator connected to your computer, and you should have a console
interface waiting for directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step is to set the voltage. It has a range of 1.2 to 3.3V and
this is going to be important for you to figure out before hand. (If you
don't know how to figure out the voltage on your board, you can probably
ask someone at Interlock to show you using a multimeter.) Then you can
choose how you'd like to scan for JTAG. There are two options, one is
more thorough and time consuming but I don't have enough data to tell
you which is better for which situation (feel free to chime in if you
know). Either one will prompt you for which pins you'd like to test
with, which should correspond to the pins you've connected on your
JTAGulator. When you run it, it will attempt every possible combination
of pins until it thinks it has found the right one. It also has a UART
discovery mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the first JTAG discovery product out there but it's the
first I've used. I mentioned that the project is open source so here is
a link to Joe's site to help you build your own board if you want, or if
you're like me, you can buy them from a company like
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.adafruit.com/blog/2013/10/04/new-product-grand-ideas-studio-jtagulator/"&gt;Adafruit&lt;/a&gt;,

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/12/wpid-IMG_20121215_143018.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="/wp-uploads/2012/12/wpid-IMG_20121215_143018.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees were friends and family of the couple including Walter 's
daughters who he setup on Skype to stream the wedding live. Our resident
video podcaster Radical Geek recorded the&amp;nbsp;ceremony&amp;nbsp;and I, with my newly
acquired&amp;nbsp;credentials from the Universal Life Church&amp;nbsp;Monastery&amp;nbsp;that I
signed up for on the Internet,&amp;nbsp;solemnized the wedding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian, also decided to do a 3D sculpture of the Walter and Cheryl so he
took a bunch of pictures as they held hands. With the help of some
software, he'll be able to turn them into a 3D model and hopefully print
them out so they look like cake toppers. Congratulations guys!&lt;/p&gt;

how this silly little RF remote communicates to its home base. The
remote controls a music playing device and since it's RF, the project
required me to learn about radio frequencies and some hardware hacking.
I've been asking Interlock members for help and they've given me ideas
along the way. JustBill, one of our radio hackers, has jumped on the
project and started analyzing the remote from the RF perspective.
Berticus and Robo Alex have also donated their brains for the hardware
hacking portion. Our goal was to learn how the remote works so that we
can make our own remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="rf-rc"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;RF RC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This radio frequency remote control (RF RC)&amp;nbsp;controls &amp;nbsp;a device that
plays music. For the purpose of this post, that's all we need to care
about it. Our first step was to do recon on the hardware so we
researched the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://transition.fcc.gov/oet/ea/fccid/"&gt;FCC
documents&lt;/a&gt;. Taking it apart
we learn that there are two boards we want to worry about. The remote
board that has an integrated circuit (IC) to handle button presses, and
a radio daughter board that takes input and converts it to a a radio
signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/07/DSC_8657.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" class="size-medium wp-image-969 alignnone" src="/wp-uploads/2012/07/DSC_8657-300x198.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 198px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/07/DSC_8664.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="alignnone" src="/wp-uploads/2012/07/DSC_8664-198x300.jpg" style="width: 198px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;`&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&amp;lt;/wp-uploads/2012/07/DSC_8664.jpg&amp;gt;`__&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ir-ic"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IR IC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After taking apart the remote, we look at the lower portion to find an
IC made by Hynix. Thankfully,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.skhynix.com/en/index.jsp"&gt;Hynix&lt;/a&gt; still sells a similar
chip that's designed for infra-red (IR) and was nice enough to give the
pin outs in the data sheet that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/07/hynix_circuit.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-973" src="/wp-uploads/2012/07/hynix_circuit-300x192.png" style="width: 300px; height: 192px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tells us most of what we want to know to see what happens during a
button press. We verify this with a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.saleae.com/logic/"&gt;Salae Logic
Analyzer&lt;/a&gt; that I love a lot, and we can
make this block diagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/07/HYNIX_chiplayout.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-964" src="/wp-uploads/2012/07/HYNIX_chiplayout-246x300.png" style="width: 246px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logic analyzer also gave us a good quality sample of what the signal
looks like before it is sent to the RF daughter board. In the diagram
above, if you look at the thicker line, this represents the
communication going from the Hynix chip, to the RF daughter board. And
that signal looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/07/logic_comparison_IR_DECODE-e1342714104358.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image4" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-975" src="/wp-uploads/2012/07/logic_comparison_IR_DECODE-e1342714104358-300x40.png" style="width: 300px; height: 40px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's interesting about this is if you look at it closely, it's has 32
transitions from digital HIGH to digital LOW during a single
transmission. If you split them up into bytes, we now see 4 groups of
data being transmitted. The first group is the sync to tell the device
to listen and is always &amp;quot;0 1011101.&amp;quot; The second is a PIN that can be set
to make sure the remote only talks to this device and not other ones.
Basically, this is a passcode that can be anywhere from 000 to 255. The
third group is the button ID. This tells which button is being pressed.
The last group is a verification of the button ID which is done by doing
a bit flip of the previous binary. &amp;quot;00000001&amp;quot; turns into &amp;quot;11111110.&amp;quot; So
I created a map of the useful button IDs for later: Power is decimal 30,
volume up is 79, pause is 76, and mysterious &amp;quot;P1&amp;quot; is 14. So if we wanted
to transmit a power button with a pin code of &amp;quot;000&amp;quot; it would look like
this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;01011101 00000000 01111000 10000111&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="rf-rf"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;RF RF&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons this project became fun was because the radio doesn't
transmit on IR. It's RF only. This means that all the amateur radio
operators at Interlock could come to my rescue and explain what was
going on. First we needed to find out what carrier frequency it used. It
turns out that we didn't have to look to far because both the carrier
frequency and the modulation type were in the remote's owners manual!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/07/CF_manual.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image5" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-984" src="/wp-uploads/2012/07/CF_manual.png" style="width: 334px; height: 49px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case 433.92MHz FSK are for new versions of this device and
27.145MHz are for older.&amp;nbsp;433.92MHz is in the&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band"&gt;ISM
band&lt;/a&gt; and used by a lot of
small electronics like a garage door opener. Our first goal was to
capture a sample of the RF so that we could analyze the data in some
kind of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform"&gt;FFT&lt;/a&gt;.
This would tell us the data inside of the transmission as well as
confirm which type of encoding it was using.
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-shift_keying"&gt;FSK&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude-shift_keying"&gt;ASK&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-shift_keying"&gt;PSK&lt;/a&gt;, etc)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/07/DSC_8664.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image6" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-972" src="/wp-uploads/2012/07/DSC_8664-198x300.jpg" style="width: 198px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first attempts to use ham radio equipment were a failure. We later
found out that the equipment could listen on 433.92MHz, but the ham
equipment was listening on too narrow of a bandwidth to correctly
capture the entire signal. The company I work for was happy to lend me
their USRP. Yay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've never heard of a
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Software_Radio_Peripheral"&gt;USRP&lt;/a&gt;,
this is what ham guys normally call a software defined radio, or a radio
that can be a range of frequencies depending on what you program it to
be. You can control things like bandwidth and frequency by sending it a
simple command. The USRP was designed by Ettus Labs and sold to National
Instruments and has become a defacto part of the RF hackers' toolkit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this, we were able to get a good sampling of the transmission from
the remote that looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/07/omfg_iv_had_this_the_whole_time-e1342715544473.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image7" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-963" src="/wp-uploads/2012/07/omfg_iv_had_this_the_whole_time-e1342715544473-300x56.png" style="width: 300px; height: 56px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="signal-processing"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Signal Processing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting the RF signal and the data collected from the logic analyzer, we
can now make some conclusions. Namely, that this is an extremely simple
circuit that isn't doing much encoding or modulation when its being
converted to RF. Basically the RF signal that you see above, is the
exact same as the data being sent by the Hynix chip. This will be
important later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="results"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To review we have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reversed the hardware that handles pressing the button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;captured a sample of the RF signal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discovered what data is being transmitted and how&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step was to create my own remote from scratch. I did this using
an Arduino and an RF chip designed to transmit on 433.92MHz. Thanks to
Robo Alex for setting this thing up for me. It turns out I don't need
the ground plane which is that giant piece of copper in the picture, but
it doesn't hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/07/IMG_20120707_150902-e1342717151722.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image8" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-978" src="/wp-uploads/2012/07/IMG_20120707_150902-e1342717151722-300x152.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 152px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What this does right now, is transmit on 433.92MHz, whatever button that
I'd like, supplying whatever PIN code that I'd like. When I capture the
data using the USRP, I find that my Arduino kit transmits perfectly at
433.92MHz while the remote has an offset of about 60 hertz so that it
transmits at 433.98Mhz. That's kind of a deal breaker for me right now
and I'm looking for a replacement IC or something else so that I can
transmit on the correct carrier freq. Until then, enjoy this random
data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/07/usrp.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image9" class="aligncenter" src="/wp-uploads/2012/07/usrp-1024x678.jpg" style="width: 614px; height: 407px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

O's) chapter is starting up organized by Jason Ross. What's a Jason Ross
and what's a TOOOL right? Jason is the newest Interlock member and comes
from a background in security - computer security, network security,
physical security.. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://i.qkme.me/7dck.jpg"&gt;secure all the
things!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="why-lock-picking"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Lock Picking?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/04/a_misery1990.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" class="size-full wp-image-861 aligncenter" src="/wp-uploads/2012/04/a_misery1990.jpg" style="width: 590px; height: 403px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's happened to the best of us, your bloodshot eyes open to find that
you've been strapped to a bed with handcuffs again. What do you do to
get out? Call for help? Wait until the lady comes back to break your
legs like in Misery? No, you know how the locking mechanism works on a
pair of handcuffs and you shim your way out and escape through the
window to freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lock picking is learning about how locks work which turns them into a
puzzle. The number of pins in a tumbler tells you how difficult the lock
is. What does it mean when a pair of handcuffs are double locked? What
are security pins? What's the difference between a wafer lock and a pin
tumbler? If you have these questions, TOOOL is the group to talk with to
have them answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="toool"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TOOOL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.toool.us"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="http://toool.us/images/toool_logo_lg.gif" style="width: 485px; height: 176px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.toool.us"&gt;TOOOL&lt;/a&gt;is The Open Organization Of
Lockpickers. These guys love to learn and teach about locks, lock
picking, and physical security. The difference between TOOOL and a
normal locksmith, is first they don't do it for money, second, they
exchange information about locks and lock picking openly, and third,
they have more of a sense of humor than your standard locksmith. To
become a locksmith, normally you'd have to learn through an
apprenticeship. TOOOL on the other hand will be giving presentations to
the community, teaching people how to pick locks, and helping spread the
knowledge about lock picking openly to the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="legality"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Legality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is having a pair of lock picks legal? Is it against the law to know how
to lock pick? What if TSA finds a set of lock picks in your bag?? These
are all boring, but serious questions that TOOOL will answer. Here's a
hint, do you think Interlock would promote illegal activity on their
blog?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-to-expect-at-the-meeting"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What to expect at the meeting:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2012/04/2011-05-07_16-57-041.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" class="alignright size-full wp-image-868" src="/wp-uploads/2012/04/2011-05-07_16-57-041.jpg" style="width: 292px; height: 478px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The meeting is open to the public and is meant to be the first
of future meetings. There will be a presentation of some kind related to
lock picking and a lot of discussion about how future meetings will
happen. The organization requires that you become a member in order to
keep up to date on the groups activities but there will also be public
non-member, public meetings in the future. If you can't come to
tonight's meeting but you're interested in learning about how the group
works, you can email &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:algorythm%20at%20the%20gmails%20dot%20come"&gt;Jason
Ross&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rochester TOOOL Chapter meeting starts at 7pm on 4/19 at Interlock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian wowed them with his always crowd pleasing custom pen &lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}/barcamp-rochester.rst"&gt;plot-matrix
printer he's famous
for&lt;/a&gt;. The

questions about Interlock. Von, showed off the ham radio room and his
skills for speaking with human beings. Bill spoke about his background,
why he has been involved with Interlock, and included some razzle dazzle
by printing on the 3D printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian, with his boyish good looks, sparkled on camera while showing off
his knowledge of all things blinky. I have to admit that while it's nice
to have Interlock get some PR, my first goal in setting up the interview
was to get Brian's face on TV. If you've met Brian, you'll know that
he's a very intelligent, multi-faceted, multi-facial-haired, reluctant
leader. I think that he is a very good representation of what the modern
hacker/maker looks and acts like. But, he's also not the normal talking
head you would see on TV which is why I want to get him out there even
more. I'm giggling right now thinking about seeing him on YNN now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling bad for the quiet bear-hat wearing man on the couch, YNN even
included me in a quick interview. I worked with Bill and Von on a lock
picking demo that I hope makes to air. Veronica even challenged me to a
lock picking contest where I had to go from nothing in my hands, pick up
the tools, and pick the lock. I surprisingly aced it picking a 4 pin
lock. (Thanks &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.toool.us"&gt;TOOOL&lt;/a&gt;) This will never be on the
air of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Von Brian and Bill for taking the time to come out and

Nexus is getting a lot of press about it. You may have heard of Google
Wallet or how NFC is going to be built into smart phones in the future.
Maybe you haven't thought about how it works or how to hack it.&amp;nbsp;As a
side[side(side)] project I've been working on NFC research with (as
always for me) a specific focus on the security perspectives. This is an
overview of NFC to maybe peak your interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define:NFC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near Field Communication is a way to transmit information between
intelligent devices. I know you're already thinking Bluetooth but wait.
NFC has a limitation that says in its spec that it can't be more than
.2m away from its partner during communication. It may be a bit more
depending on the implementation but the thing to remember here is that
the protocol itself is what limits the distance, not just the hardware.
(Quit pointing that gigantic antenna at my pocket right now!) It
transmits on the HF band 13.56MHz, a frequency already used by some RFID
chips and fun devices like the Proxmark 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what's different about NFC: There are three different modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reader/Writer: Commonly used in smart posters or smart stickers.
Think QR code but subtle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peer to Peer: Data is exchanged back and forth between devices;
securely exchange credit cards, give your friend your home WIFI
settings, or exchange business cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Card Emulation: A device acts like a contactless smart card. What if
you could use your phone as a bus pass instead of keeping that flimsy
magstripe pass in your pocket?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NFC != RFID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets take care of that up front. NFC sounds a lot like RFID (they share
the whole RF thing) and it seems to get stored in people's heads that
way because NFC has the card emulation mode where it emulates at &amp;quot;tag&amp;quot;
or an RFID chip. &amp;nbsp;RFID isn't usually much more than a tag blindly
broadcasting data hoping a receiver picks it up. Passive tags (or little
antennas without a power source) sit and wait for an RFID reader to come
by to energize them. They get all excited and tell the reader everything
they know. Imagine a dog just waiting at the door for it's owner to come
home. The active RFID tags have a battery in them that constantly
broadcasts itself to anyone that will listen. Kind of like that annoying
friend you have that tells you everything about their life even though
you never asked. NFC on the other hand is like an intelligent college
student. She can have an intimate conversation with you, she can make a
presentation in front of a class, but she can still get drunk and act
stupid if that's what everyone else is doing at the party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NFC is not a new technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've seen them in European phones since 2003 or 4 and they've been
hacked on for just as long. The folks at the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ccc.de/en/"&gt;Chaos Computer
Club&lt;/a&gt; have been hacking on NFC since it's
original inception; when manufacturers like Nokia started installing it
into their feature phones, AKA dumb phones. It never made it across the
water - some may say due to some FCC regulations on the 13.56 frequency
but I'll leave that topic to the Ham guys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security|image1|&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven't already, you should put on your tin foil hat now. &lt;strong&gt;NFC
is a way for corporations to take over our bodies, man!&lt;/strong&gt; Well...most
likely not. But you're already thinking about the security problems as
soon as I wrote &amp;quot;credit card.&amp;quot; I'm going to save this whole discussion
for another day but the tl;dr version is that NFC has been designed with
security in mind but a lot is left up to the developer to implement
securely. We all know how well that works especially for mobile app
developers so I'm sure everything is going to be fine, right? Maybe next
time I'll tell you about the butt sniffing attack. No seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Android and The Galaxy Nexus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is Android implementing NFC in the Galaxy Nexus? Here's an example
of a peer to peer mode connection: When you put a Galaxy Nexus next to
another Galaxy Nexus, the phone will make an NFC connection as long as
both phones are unlocked. If the app that you &amp;nbsp;have open supports NFC
(i.e. Google Maps) it will allow you to communicate data from your app
to the other device. Some examples of this are sharing contact
information, location data, websites, etc but apparently it's going to
be used for games or whatever developers can think of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Reader/Writer mode will allow you to take an NFC tag and shove it
next to the phone. Depending on the data stored on the card, it will
open an appropriate app to view the content. In the case of an NFC tag
that is contains a URL, it will automatically go to that page. Ask me
about some of the NFC tags I've made at a 2600 meeting sometime. :)&lt;/p&gt;

access to the roof.&amp;nbsp; On a beautiful fall day, Chris Olin and I put up a
30’ fiberglass mast on a tripod base (not attached to the roof).&amp;nbsp; Then
we hoisted up a trapped dipole for 10-80 meters and a G5RV.&amp;nbsp; The dipole
is oriented SW-NE, the G5RV is SE-NW.&amp;nbsp; We also put up a 2m/70 cm J-Pole
for VHF/UHF.&amp;nbsp; All the feedlines were run with previously used 8/U down
to our space (about 150’) and into the Ham Shack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We initially had a Kenwood TS-530s transceiver and roller tuner setup
for HF and we made a few contacts.&amp;nbsp; We wanted to get the Yaesu FT-857GX
out of the storage container and try it out.&amp;nbsp; That is setup now along
with an automatic tuner.&amp;nbsp; Reception seems decent.&amp;nbsp; We are waiting on an
operable microphone to get back on the air.&amp;nbsp; Bill, Von, Rowan, and Steve
are working on that.&amp;nbsp; We will be working on CAT control and a hook-up
for using SDR like functionality with Ham Radio Deluxe, allowing us to
get into the digital communication modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Yaesu FT-8800 VHF/UHF rig is working well, K2HAX normally monitors
146.61 (N2MPE local ARES/RACES repeater) while someone is in the shack.
We have cables for programming this rig on order and also have a cable
for use with the PacComm TNC for packet, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have a desktop PC with a nice monitor setup for use with the
transceivers.&amp;nbsp; We are waiting on a 2 port serial card to communicate
with the radios.&amp;nbsp; The remote programming of the radios and the option
for digital mode communications (PSK, Packet, etc) opens up with the PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our bench includes power supplies, frequency counters, various
multi-meters and hand tools.&amp;nbsp; We have a great selection of soldering
tools for discrete and SMT component work.&amp;nbsp; We have a variable
temperature iron and a variable speed and temperature blower for
re-work.&amp;nbsp; On order is a Hakko 808 de-soldering tool.&amp;nbsp; We have 2 antenna
analyzers, a new Comet and an older MFJ.&amp;nbsp; Several bench projects are
already underway including Jamie’s whispering clocks, many cable hacks
for the radios, and Walter’s attempts to repair blown audio equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ham radio is witnessing a rebirth in popularity.&amp;nbsp; Emergency preparedness
at the county/state/and national level has recognized the value of Ham
radio as the most dependable means for communication during an
emergency.&amp;nbsp; Interlock members have participated in local POD drills,
Ginna nuclear event practice response teams and are regular attendees at
the local ARES/RACES meetings.&amp;nbsp; Ham Radio can provide texting, TV and
many other familiar forms of communication without any annoying
infrastructure.&amp;nbsp; We can DX with Ham operators around the world, by voice
and many new and old digital modes.&amp;nbsp; SDR is an emerging technology
applied to Ham radio; opening up some fantastic possibilities for low
power operation, contesting, and pulling weak signals out of the noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ham radio is growing in popularity.&amp;nbsp; Interlock Hams would love to
introduce anyone interested to the hobby and answer any questions you
may have.&lt;/p&gt;

and a third of the tablets. I've been focused on Android lately and
wanted to do an&amp;nbsp;introduction&amp;nbsp;to the hackability of these devices.&amp;nbsp;From a
security perspective, Android offers some interesting opportunities:
rooting your phone, hacking an app, or malware analysis. For the
hardware hackers, Google and others are offering hardware tools that can
plug into your Android device to enable use them for your hardware
projects. If you're interested in the creative path, it's really easy to
get started doing app development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rooting:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rooting your device offers the user full control of the device to allow
to change the version of the operating system, install or uninstall any
apps you'd like, and in some cases gain access to features that would
otherwise be locked out by the carrier. If none of those interest you,
the geek cred alone may be good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rooting is nothing more than a&amp;nbsp;privilege&amp;nbsp;escalation attack. You are
granted standard user access to your phone but you'd like to escalate to
root level&amp;nbsp;privileges. Android, being built on top of Linux follows the
common practice of granting root only when necessary to your device's
operations. There are a bunch of attack vectors like exploiting a
service running as root, exploiting a file that has root access,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;App Hacking:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of fun stuff you can do to hack an Android app. It's
originally coded in Java and although Android runs it's own Java
environment called Dalvik VM, an app can be decompiled from it's byte
code to Java class files. From there you can do some reverse engineering
to take a look at how the app operates. With a little luck and skill,
you can recompile a modified version of the app. I'm not going to go too
deep into this idea but if you're interested, I'll be doing a
presentation at this years &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rochestersecurity.org"&gt;Rochester Security
Summit&lt;/a&gt; that will give you the
tools to do this analysis yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malware:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the security guys now, malware analysis is a fun way to get a peek
into how the bad guys work. Android is in a battle with malware usually
available in alternative markets. Nasty apps like &amp;quot;Nickispy&amp;quot; will steal
your personal information and even record your calls to upload them back
to a server. Some will root your device and install a backdoor like the
latest variant of DroidKungFu. With some tools and some different
analysis techniques, you can perform the analysis yourself. Jason Ross
will also be presenting this year at RSS on this topic if you're
interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardware Hacking:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this years Google IO, they announced the release of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.com/events/io/2011/sessions/android-open-accessory-api-and-development-kit-adk.html"&gt;Android
Development
Kit&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;which
is a bridge between your Android device and your hardware projects.
Imagine controlling an Arduino with a touch screen interface or using
the sensors from your phone to control a robot. As a cheap alternative
to the $300+ kit, Sparkfun has created the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10748"&gt;Android
IOIO&lt;/a&gt;, pronounced yoyo. This
is what my next project will include with a little help from the robot
crew at Interlock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;App Development:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If programming or art is your thing, or you want to make your next
million dollars on an Angry Birds killer, you can get started developing
apps on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://market.android.com/publish"&gt;Android Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;
for $25. This gets you an account to upload your app to the public
directory and it will show up on thousands of people's phones. The
Android SDK along with the Eclipse plugins make it pretty easy to
develop without too much programming knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Android At Interlock:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the coming months, along with all the other changes, we're planning
on doing an Android workshop at the space. Depending on the interest it
may be related to rooting or application development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wanted to watch a hard drive get shredded in seconds, see
a box of RAM that was 800 pounds, or wander through a 100,000 square
foot grave yard of electronics? So did we, and our tour of Regional
Computer Recycling and Recovery was just that. RCR&amp;amp;R is one of the major
electronics recyclers in the Rochester area, and we were lucky enough to
get a tour of their facilities.&amp;nbsp;They outlined the process from beginning
to end of how a computer is received, processed, parted out, and
eventually recycled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="rotating knives sign" class="photo left" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2010/12/rotatingknivessm-297x300.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of us were guided around the RCR&amp;amp;R facility after learning about
the organization. Vice president Charlie McKernen teamed up with client
service representative Tom Smith to show us the&amp;nbsp;facility, answer our
questions, and keep us on track when our attention strayed to the many
items sitting on the giant shelves.&amp;nbsp;One of the first stops was a hard
drive shredder which chopped through the devices like butter, leaving
just a pile of scraps after a few sparks. We walked by workers parting
out the computers, placing each into a corresponding box that would
eventually be shipped out for recycling by a facility specifically
designed to process that part. Charlie was able to&amp;nbsp;easily&amp;nbsp;answer our
questions on&amp;nbsp;degaussing&amp;nbsp;and secure hard drive&amp;nbsp;wiping&amp;nbsp;methods, and they
all seemed to be up to speed on the latest compliance requirements and
best practices when it came to security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tour&amp;nbsp;happened&amp;nbsp;on the same day that the Democrat and Chronicle
published &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.democratandchronicle.com/article/20101227/NEWS01/12270323/1002/NEWS/Effort-aims-to-cut-waste-electronics"&gt;an
article&lt;/a&gt;
discussing a New York State law touting a state wide, free e-waste
recycling program. Passed in May, the law will make electronics
manufacturers responsible for the waste generated when a computer is
recycled. Current NYS law allows computers to be thrown out as part of
your regular trash, leaking contaminants into the ground.
Hazardous&amp;nbsp;metals like lead and mercury, and the chemicals that make
plastics flame retardant can cause damage to the environment. The new
law aims to get consumers recycling their old electronics by offsetting
the cost back to the manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can visit the RCR&amp;amp;R &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ewaste.com"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; for more
information about their facility and services, and be sure to check out
their &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://stores.ebay.com/Electronics-Cafe"&gt;Electronics Cafe&lt;/a&gt;
eBay store if you're interested in seeing all of the fun stuff they have
for sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Their facility is 100,000 sqft in Victor and their Central Ave.
location is 20,000 sqft.&lt;/p&gt;

this wasn't the original date of our inception, it was the agreed upon
time to meet, discuss what we did the year before, announce plans for
the year after, decide upon the budget, and share ideas that could help
improve Interlock as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first year was packed with tasks necessary for putting together a
hackerspace from the ground up. &amp;nbsp;Starting out, we were a group of people
meeting in a coffee shop with an idea and we quickly transitioned into
getting a space to call home, incorporating the organization and
designing the bylaws for the group. &amp;nbsp;We worked with community leaders to
attend events like Barcamp Rochester and partnered up with our friends
at CoWorking Rochester for lightning talks. And in between all of that,
we tried to make time for our personal projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was fun to hear what members had been working on in the space this
year. Arduinos, Apple 2c+ hacking, knitting, networking, photography,
infosec, robotics, ham radio, makerbot plans, virtualization, lock
picking, phone systems, classes,&amp;nbsp;aerial&amp;nbsp;photography, are just a few of
the projects we worked on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This coming year, we have some exciting new ideas for everyone &amp;nbsp;and the
members have even more ideas for their own projects. &amp;nbsp;Some of those
ideas are about improving Interlock for the public and our community
like offering different membership options. &amp;nbsp;We're also working on ideas
for a project we can work on as a group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally as part of our business planning, we reviewed our financial
situation and approved a budget. &amp;nbsp;You can take a look at our costs and
where the money goes from 2010 below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2010/12/2010_expenses.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Financial numbers for 2010" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-306" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2010/12/2010_expenses-300x124.png" style="width: 300px; height: 124px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A thanks goes out to all of our members and friends who donate their
time, money, and ideas to our cause. &amp;nbsp;We seriously couldn't have done it
without you.&lt;/p&gt;

random subject they've just learned. The talks showed the range of
knowledge of Interlock from artificial intellegence, soldering, art
history, orienteering, making booklets, cross site scripting attacks,
the board game go, IRSSI, cat5 cables, learning how to program, things
going on at RIT, guest wireless access points, offsite backup solutions,
and 3D molecule rendering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you've never heard of the idea, it's easy. You make a presentation
but it's only 5 minutes long. We'd like to have everyone involved. The
more presentations we have the better. The only rules is, you have 5
minutes and you will be timed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're not a member, we want you to come and you can even do a talk
or just sit back and be entertained.&amp;nbsp; Anyone that would like to be added
to the list can email antitree at interlock roc dot org.&lt;/p&gt;

crammed into our temporary hackerspace sitting on anything we could
find. &amp;nbsp;Thanks to everyone that made it out and especially those that
took the time to put a talk together.&lt;/p&gt;
