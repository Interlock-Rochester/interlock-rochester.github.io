Interlock HAM radio station K2HAX will be participating in the &lt;a href="http://www.arrl.org/field-day"&gt;ARRL Field Day&lt;/a&gt; event.   We will be doing it in Palmyra.  A 2600 attendee (@pee) has offered to let us use land.  We are going to doing it purely off grid with generators, solar, and batteries.  The event runs from Saturday June 24th 2:00 PM (18:00 UTC) through Sunday June 25th 4:59 PM (20:59 UTC).  I (JustBill/KC2YPJ) will be there all night camping with the radios and working them.  I will have radios and antenna's.  All are welcome, bring family and have fun.  You are welcome to stay the night if you want as well just coordinate with me.   This is currently a bring your own food/refreshment event.  I'll try to have some water available for general public.&lt;/p&gt;

to make updates and upgrades to our systems. &amp;nbsp; This has happened
recently with the upgraded wireless infrastructure right here at
Interlock. &amp;nbsp;While this was done about a month back, full production cut
over happened earlier this week. &amp;nbsp;We were using a Meraki (Cisco) based
wireless system. &amp;nbsp;While nice, it had an annual renewal cost that was
unfortunately not sustainable for us. &amp;nbsp;After much research and
thoughtful debate, the decision was to use a Ubiquiti based wireless
system. Here are some action shots of the team installing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2015/05/20150428_193446-e1432343321802.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="20150428_193446" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1958" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2015/05/20150428_193446-e1432343321802-169x300.jpg" style="width: 169px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wonderfully professional install if you ask me. &amp;nbsp;Here is a nice image of
the layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see we have upgraded to having a 5 Ghz AP as well. &amp;nbsp;If you
want to use it please be aware that we have some new SSIDs created.
INTLK-Member (for members) and INTLK-Guest (for guests).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please enjoy your new wireless experience at Interlock Rochester.&lt;/p&gt;
