    <p>Halloween time again. Last year I tried to do a simple little hardware
project to make my emoticon pumpkins glow. That's cute and all but not
very difficult.</p>
<p>This year, I decided to work on this idea I've had for more than a year
and a half. <strong>The Brain - a silicone based brain with controllable
LEDs inside.</strong> I have some ideas of what to do next with it, but this
first iteration is just to be a fun decoration for Halloween.</p>

<div class="section" id="why-the-brain">
<h2>Why The Brain</h2>
<p>Back when Interlock was moving into their current space, there was this
cool area in the center of it, that was surrounded by windows. That
turned into the network room and I really wanted to use that window for
something. Show something cool in the window or whatever. I came up with
this idea that I would have a brain to represent network activity. When
a host goes down, the brain reflects that. If there was no Internet
connectivity, the brain would show that too. The first version of the
brain is not to that level yet, but it's in the right direction.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="brain-1-0">
<h2>Brain 1.0</h2>
<p>Brain 1.0 is a Platsil GEL-10, silicone brain with a hollowed center. In
the center is a plastic project box housing an Arduino with Neo Pixels
attached to it. A Neo Pixel is an Adafruit project that is meant to be a
low cost, multi-color LED that you can daisy-chain, or string together
in-line. There's really no reason to use Neo Pixels for this project
besides the fact that I had some already.</p>
<p>Parts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Halloween Brain Jello mold from Amazon</li>
<li>Platsil GEL-10 from&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.shop.brickintheyard.com/PlatSil-Gel-10-Pint-Kit-2-Lbs-Gel10U2.htm">BITY Mold
Supply</a></li>
<li>Tupperware container donated to the cause</li>
<li>XL Breaking Bad meth making gloves</li>
<li>Mixing containers</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="making-the-brain">
<h2>Making the Brain:</h2>
<p>This was the most interesting part to me. I picked up the type of
PlatSil that is a 1 to 1 compound either by volume or by mass so I
didn't need to worry about mixing too much. I took 500ML of A and mixed
it with 500ML of B. This stuff has a 6 minute lifetime from the time you
start mixing to the time it starts to harden. There are ways to slow
this down, but again, I didn't need to do that. I spent 2 minutes mixing
because some guy on YouTube said this is important, and my recent
adventures in Thermite taught me the lesson that they're serious.</p>
<p>Before I poured it in, I used a can of &nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.shop.brickintheyard.com/Pol-Ease-2300-12-Oz-Spray-Can-2300.htm">Pol-Ease
2300</a>&nbsp;release
which is used to keep the brain separated from the Jello mold. I was
reminded the hard way what happens when you forget this. Pouring it into
the mold was pretty simple but I made a small clay holder for it so I
could make sure it stayed level. After the contents were dumped in, I
sunk the plastic project container that was going to be my hollowed
inside.</p>
<p>The whole things hardens within 30 minutes but because mine was in the
garage in October, it was more like an hour.</p>
<p>Because this stuff isn't very cheap, I did a demo mold just to make sure
I was on the right track.</p>

<div class="section" id="platsil-gel-10">
<h2>PlatSil Gel-10:</h2>
<p>My goal was to create a mold of a brain that was rubbery and brain like.
This Platsil line of chemicals are designed to create molds for other
things. There wasn't a lot of people making actual things from the
material itself but I really like the texture and toughness of using it
as the model. I will say that it is 100% overkill for what I wanted.
There's probably someone that can recommend a
better,&nbsp;cheaper<strong>,</strong>&nbsp;alternative but for me this worked in the time
frame I needed it to. They have a bunch of different types and I really
wanted light to diffuse through it so I got that translucent version. It
still comes out pretty white depending on how thick of a mold you're
making.</p>

<div class="section" id="neo-pixel">
<h2>Neo Pixel:</h2>
<p>Neo Pixels are really slick. They have 4 leads on them. Power, Ground,
signal in, and a signal out. The biggest benefit is that each pixel is
individually addressable without the need for multiple connections.
Pixel 0 connects to pixel 1 that connects to pixel N through a single
&nbsp;wire connected to your microcontroller or whatever you're using.</p>
<p>Power takes +5v, and there is a warning about memory consumption
especially with smaller Arduinos and extremely long chains of Neo Pixels
(up to 500 at 30 FPS). My 4 didn't mind.</p>
<p>Adafruit has a&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel">Neo Pixel
library</a>&nbsp;that you can
use pretty easily, even if you just want to hack one of their demos.</p>

<p>This is my hacked code to make the brain throb between red and pink.
Again, a Neo Pixel is overkill for doing this but it's fun none-the-less
