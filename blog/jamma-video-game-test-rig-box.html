<p>I decided to package up my JAMMA test rig so that I could demo Crazy
Otto at Rochester BarCamp for today. &nbsp;My design was basically a box that
would house the entire thing, with a nice control panel for player 1.
&nbsp;As you can see in the above image, I have the A/V cable going to an
external monitor. &nbsp;Broken out on the box are player 1 and 2 start, coin
1, and player 1 controls - joystick and 3 buttons. &nbsp;On the right side of
the box are the three &quot;coin box&quot; controls -- Test, Tilt, and Service,
for testing those functions of the board. &nbsp;Also on that side is a nice
handle to help it be portable.</p>
<p>This is a continuation of&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://geodesicsphere.blogspot.com/2014/02/updating-my-jamma-test-rig.html">part 1, where I updated the AV connections
of the
rig</a>.</p>

<p>This is about the extent of blueprints I have for this. &nbsp;I knew I needed
14&quot; depth for the monitor, and that it needed about a 2&quot; rise from the
back to the front to put it at a good angle. &nbsp;I wanted it to be 18&quot;
wide, and 24&quot; deep. &nbsp;That would give enough room for a game board inside
of it, as well as for a decent sized control panel.</p>

<p>I started by cutting a sheet of plywood I've had in our garage
for a while. &nbsp;I also built the control panel using spare parts I had.
&nbsp;Thanks to members of Interlock to help me use the table saw, suggest
tools and offer bits of wood. &nbsp;:D</p>

<p>Some standard microswitch buttons, and a nice ball-top leaf-switch
joystick.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cydJ39iIQvw/U1M3gCeS2fI/AAAAAAAACwo/1n4QMzmT-YE/s1600/2014-04-13+00.02.24.jpg"><img alt="image5" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F1.bp.blogspot.com%2F-cydJ39iIQvw%2FU1M3gCeS2fI%2FAAAAAAAACwo%2F1n4QMzmT-YE%2Fs1600%2F2014-04-13%2B00.02.24.jpg&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /></a></p>
<p>The basic construction is that I glued some cleats on the inside of each
side. Then the back, bottom, front and control panel will be screwed to
it. &nbsp;After that, it looked like this:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3K5F7U_IA6Q/U1M4kGWWFKI/AAAAAAAACw4/LiOxY_9eV34/s1600/2014-04-15+23.18.31.jpg"><img alt="image6" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F3.bp.blogspot.com%2F-3K5F7U_IA6Q%2FU1M4kGWWFKI%2FAAAAAAAACw4%2FLiOxY_9eV34%2Fs1600%2F2014-04-15%2B23.18.31.jpg&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /></a></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FAKRknjQsgQ/U1M4l9zfgjI/AAAAAAAACxA/0r_V0GPYYVg/s1600/2014-04-15+23.18.51.jpg"><img alt="image7" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F2.bp.blogspot.com%2F-FAKRknjQsgQ%2FU1M4l9zfgjI%2FAAAAAAAACxA%2F0r_V0GPYYVg%2Fs1600%2F2014-04-15%2B23.18.51.jpg&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /></a></p>
<p>I also cut and drilled a small metal bracket to hold the power supply in
place, which you can see in the above. &nbsp;The coin 1 button on the front
has a 12v light in it. &nbsp;The old P2 controller is still attached to the
JAMMA rig, in case I want to test/play 2 player games. &nbsp;You can also see
the 1 1/4&quot; fine thread drywall screws holding it together here. &nbsp;From
here, the only change is that I painted it, stinking up our garage in
the process. heh. &nbsp;The top lid hooks under the control panel, and has a
cleat in the back to keep it from sliding off the back. &nbsp;There's a
single screw to hold it in place, and to let it be carried withot the
contents falling out.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eZu5wH69luQ/U1M5zDFWpfI/AAAAAAAACxM/jCR3iqEw1F4/s1600/2014-04-19+16.57.49.jpg"><img alt="image8" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F2.bp.blogspot.com%2F-eZu5wH69luQ%2FU1M5zDFWpfI%2FAAAAAAAACxM%2FjCR3iqEw1F4%2Fs1600%2F2014-04-19%2B16.57.49.jpg&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="width: 480px; height: 640px;" /></a></p>
<p>The great thing about this thing is that it's easy to tote this thing
around to play/demo games and such. &nbsp;It takes two trips since the
monitor is cumbersome, and the box itself is pretty heavy, but it's
SIGNIFICANTLY easier than toting around a full arcade cabinet.</p>
<p>For reference, here's the JAMMA pinout standard: &nbsp;(Most games since the
late 1980s use this or a variant of it -- for example, Neo Geo adds
additional buttons on unused pins, Rampart uses a trackball on the
joystick pins, and Mortal Kombat has additional buttons on another
interface harness.)</p>

<p>The power and ground at the top portion are wired directly to the old PC
power supply. &nbsp;Coin counters and lockout coils are not wired to
anything. &nbsp;The speaker wires are broken out to a RCA plug, and the Video
(RGB,Sync) are out to a DIN connector, as seen in the previous post.
&nbsp;Service, Tilt, and Test are wired to the three switches on the side of
the box. &nbsp;Coin switch 1, and the two start buttons are on the control
panel, as are all of the 1P controls (on the right).</p>
