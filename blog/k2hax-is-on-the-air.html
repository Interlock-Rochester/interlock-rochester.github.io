    <p><a class="reference external" href="/wp-uploads/2011/11/ham_temp-e1322411639629.jpg"><img alt="image0" class="alignright size-full wp-image-707" src="/wp-uploads/2011/11/ham_temp-e1322411759170.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: 569px;" /></a>K2HAX is on the air!&nbsp; With our move to the new space, we have
access to the roof.&nbsp; On a beautiful fall day, Chris Olin and I put up a
30’ fiberglass mast on a tripod base (not attached to the roof).&nbsp; Then
we hoisted up a trapped dipole for 10-80 meters and a G5RV.&nbsp; The dipole
is oriented SW-NE, the G5RV is SE-NW.&nbsp; We also put up a 2m/70 cm J-Pole
for VHF/UHF.&nbsp; All the feedlines were run with previously used 8/U down
to our space (about 150’) and into the Ham Shack.</p>
<p>We initially had a Kenwood TS-530s transceiver and roller tuner setup
for HF and we made a few contacts.&nbsp; We wanted to get the Yaesu FT-857GX
out of the storage container and try it out.&nbsp; That is setup now along
with an automatic tuner.&nbsp; Reception seems decent.&nbsp; We are waiting on an
operable microphone to get back on the air.&nbsp; Bill, Von, Rowan, and Steve
are working on that.&nbsp; We will be working on CAT control and a hook-up
for using SDR like functionality with Ham Radio Deluxe, allowing us to
get into the digital communication modes.</p>
<p>The Yaesu FT-8800 VHF/UHF rig is working well, K2HAX normally monitors
146.61 (N2MPE local ARES/RACES repeater) while someone is in the shack.
We have cables for programming this rig on order and also have a cable
for use with the PacComm TNC for packet, etc.</p>
<p>We also have a desktop PC with a nice monitor setup for use with the
transceivers.&nbsp; We are waiting on a 2 port serial card to communicate
with the radios.&nbsp; The remote programming of the radios and the option
for digital mode communications (PSK, Packet, etc) opens up with the PC.</p>
<p>Our bench includes power supplies, frequency counters, various
multi-meters and hand tools.&nbsp; We have a great selection of soldering
tools for discrete and SMT component work.&nbsp; We have a variable
temperature iron and a variable speed and temperature blower for
re-work.&nbsp; On order is a Hakko 808 de-soldering tool.&nbsp; We have 2 antenna
analyzers, a new Comet and an older MFJ.&nbsp; Several bench projects are
already underway including Jamie’s whispering clocks, many cable hacks
for the radios, and Walter’s attempts to repair blown audio equipment.</p>
<p>Ham radio is witnessing a rebirth in popularity.&nbsp; Emergency preparedness
at the county/state/and national level has recognized the value of Ham
radio as the most dependable means for communication during an
emergency.&nbsp; Interlock members have participated in local POD drills,
Ginna nuclear event practice response teams and are regular attendees at
the local ARES/RACES meetings.&nbsp; Ham Radio can provide texting, TV and
many other familiar forms of communication without any annoying
infrastructure.&nbsp; We can DX with Ham operators around the world, by voice
and many new and old digital modes.&nbsp; SDR is an emerging technology
applied to Ham radio; opening up some fantastic possibilities for low
power operation, contesting, and pulling weak signals out of the noise.</p>
<p>Ham radio is growing in popularity.&nbsp; Interlock Hams would love to
introduce anyone interested to the hobby and answer any questions you
may have.</p>
