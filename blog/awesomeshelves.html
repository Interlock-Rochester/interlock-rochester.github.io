<p>Hi all! I'd like to formally announce something that we've (kinda) been
working on for a little while now.</p>
<p>THE INTERLOCK SHELVES OF POTENTIAL AWESOME!</p>
<p>It is a library of sorts... &nbsp;The idea is this: &nbsp;If you want to try out
one of the dev kits that are there, you can&nbsp;sign them out for your own
use. &nbsp;Preferrably something that you will write a blog post for. ;) &nbsp;but
even if you just want to sit down with one and mess with it for a week
or two, go for it!</p>
<p>Here's a list of what's currently available on the shelf:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://tinyurl.com/ks6gdtu">http://tinyurl.com/ks6gdtu</a></p>
<p>In that list you will find an inventory ID that matches the ID on the
tag attached to each package. &nbsp;You will also find a contact person who
may be able to help or at least point you in the right direction for
what these things are, how to use them, etc.</p>
<p>For now, these items are borrow-only. &nbsp;We are working on a way for these
items to be purchasable in the future. &nbsp;For example, if you start using
one, and integrate it into your awesome project, we would like for there
to be a way for you to purchase it from the space. If there's something
you want to borrow, contact Scott to check it out. We'll eventually have
some sort of fancy computer-assisted self-operated inventory system, but
for now, we'll go with this.</p>
<p>We are looking for more borrow-donations for the shelf! If you have
more, please let us know! &nbsp;I'd like to make more Arduino boards
available, as well as modernish laptops and possibly retro computers for
people to borrow and play with.</p>
<p>In the near future, I will be setting up a laptop or two with a guest
account to be stored there for borrowing in case you want to work on
something at the space but forgot your own kit at home.</p>
<p>There is also a CD case disguised as a &quot;1997 MSDN Subscription&quot; box.
&nbsp;This is currently filled with empty disc sleeves, but in the future, it
will be populated with various install media for various old and new
hardware. &nbsp;I will be bringing in disc media for some obsolete systems to
be put in there. I'd like for one of you Linux Master Craftspeople to
burn a copy or two of the current preferred
desktop/server/32/64/whatever discs to be stored in there. &nbsp;We will
catalog the contents as things get added.</p>
