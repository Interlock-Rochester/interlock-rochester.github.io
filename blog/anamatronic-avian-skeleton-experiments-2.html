    <p>I'm about to start making the skeleton for my animatronic Tiki-Room
Macaw. &nbsp;Rather than futzing with drawing up detailed plans in some cad
program, Iv'e decided to instead get the basic shape made, and then just
build one out of foam core. &nbsp;My thought was that once I have the shape
worked out, I'll disassemble it and come up with plans for 3d printable
parts that can be attached together, and eventually some vacuum formed
parts as well for the head and beak, which need to be lightweight...
although I'm starting to think that they could all be 3D printed, with a
skin stretched over them for feathers and fur, after seeing&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://hackaday.com/?s=acetone">the posts
on Hack-A-Day about using acetone vapor to smooth out
parts</a>... anyway..</p>
<p>One of the things I was unsure of was the control linkages, and how the
articulation points can be made. &nbsp;It needs to have a few points of
articulation to match the birds in the Enchanted Tiki Room:</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>Perch rotation - 270 degrees, spins the bird around (not shown)</li>
<li>Lean - +20, -20 degrees, to lean forward and backward at the point
where the legs connect</li>
<li>Head yaw - +45, -45 degrees back and forth</li>
<li>Head tilt - +15, -15 degrees up and down</li>
<li>Beak - 30 degrees, could be all open or all closed (shown in the
diagram as 15 degrees)</li>
</ul>
<p>I was thinking that after I constructed the foam version, I could figure
things out from there, but after seeing&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://hackaday.com/2013/02/28/3d-printed-hog-drive/">this post on Hack-A-Day with
a &quot;HOG Drive&quot;</a>,
I realized I could leverage off of this design for the head linkages.</p>
<p>I chatted with Skip at&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="/">Interlock</a>, and
by the end of this last Tuesday evening, I had two 3-D printed versions
of this, using ABS, rather than the PLA material I am
more&nbsp;familiar&nbsp;with. (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:52097">Here's the Thingiverse link for the
design</a>.) Since I wasn't
going to be mounting a motor, we (and by &quot;we&quot; I mean &quot;he&quot;) replaced the
motor space with a flat plate with a mounting screw hole. &nbsp;He also
replaced the back control arm with just a peg, since the bridge-like
shape wouldn't hold up properly on his printer.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-w3-dNOYQiBU/UTdp-unGYKI/AAAAAAAACX4/UgL3sYxLOsc/s1600/2013-03-05+23.23.34.jpg"><img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-w3-dNOYQiBU/UTdp-unGYKI/AAAAAAAACX4/UgL3sYxLOsc/s640/2013-03-05+23.23.34.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /></a></p>
<p>The first print (on the left) has a failed control peg on the center
disk. &nbsp;It was adding material onto printed material that didn't cool
yet, so it just kinda globbed up. &nbsp;This was improved by Skip by adding a
second post, seen in the second version on the right. &nbsp;He also added
some material around the screw holes in the frame, to improve
durability.</p>
<p>After printing and having this in my hand, I'm realizing that it won't
quite work for me, although it does give me an excellent starting point.
&nbsp;The center disk is too small to mount the head on. &nbsp;It's only about 1
1/2 inches in diameter. I think I'd want something about 2-3&quot; in
diameter, with plenty of mounting points and space for securing the head
,as well as space for wiring for the beak servo (or linear motor, or
solenoid, or whatever). &nbsp;It really showed me the design considerations
for actually constructing something, not to mention it
really&nbsp;emphasized&nbsp;that whatever design I can think of, I can print...
which is pretty&nbsp;futuristically&nbsp;awesome.</p>
<p>But the important thing is that I know have ideas to build on for the
final version. &nbsp;I'll still be constructing a foam core model, and I'll
be using this above design as a kick-off point.</p>
