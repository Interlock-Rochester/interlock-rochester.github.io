<p>Two long weeks ago, we finally scrounged the equipment and ingredients
necessary to iterate <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hackpittsburgh.org/brewing-open-mate-soda">Hack Pittsburgh's Open Mate
recipe</a>.
Personally, I hadn't heard of this odd <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club-Mate">Club
Mate</a> beverage until I saw
the recipe, but -- being a homebrewer -- I couldn't help but to order a
case (for comparison purposes only, of course) and hunt down some <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerba_mat%C3%A9">yerba
mat√©</a> and caffeine
powder of my own.</p>
<p>With said ingredients in hand, we put three gallons of water on the hot
plate during one of our Tuesday open nights (come visit!), and proceeded
to spend three hours hovering around the kitchen area, waiting for it to
get anywhere near boiling. The tea was brewed, sugared, cooled, and
kegged with the following specifications:</p>
<div class="section" id="ingredients">
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>3 gallons of water</li>
<li>3oz yerba mate tea</li>
<li>2c sugar</li>
<li>juice of 0.5 lemons</li>
<li>0.5t citric acid</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="procedure">
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>bring water to just under a boil</li>
<li>add tea to water (I put the tea in a big homebrewing grain bag,
effectively creating a huge teabag)</li>
<li>steep for six minutes</li>
<li>remove tea</li>
<li>add sugar, lemon juice, citric acid</li>
<li>cool, pour into a keg, carbonate at 20psi</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll notice we skipped the caffeine this time. Personally, I'm more
concerned with flavor than (added) stimulants, so I never bothered
tracking down a scale sensitive enough to measure out one or two grams
of powder. Feel free to add that in when you're adding the sugar (check
out <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hackpittsburgh.org/brewing-open-mate-soda">Hack Pittsburgh's
recipe</a> for the
correct measurements and warnings).</p>

<div class="section" id="yum">
<h2>Yum?</h2>
<p>We finally got to do some beta tasting this past Thursday, and all
testers agreed that it was yummy and pretty faithful to the original
product. I have since sat down for a more in-depth side-by-side
comparison (not double-blinded, mind you), and I feel our recipe --
although quite tasty -- has come up a bit short compared to the real
deal. The sweetness is spot on, but there is a complexity and depth to
the tea flavor that is missing in our beverage. So I think we'll try
some things differently next time:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>adding lemon was a mistake: I was hoping to avoid uncommon
ingredients like citric acid, but alas, you should go out and get
some (cream of tartar was a pretty popular substitute in old-timey
ginger beer recipes)</li>
<li>more citric acid: fizzy tea is pretty dull without a bit of acid
zing. We should probably at least double it next time, but further
experimentation is in order</li>
<li>increase the tea input: I'm hoping part of the depth-of-flavor
difference is merely a matter of strength</li>
<li>caramelize some of the sugar first: Club Mate has added coloring.
Hopefully caramelizing some of the sugar will make Open Mate less
pale, and also improve flavor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any other ideas? I can't wait to work through our first three gallons,
so we can start brewing the next version. Bottoms up!</p>
