  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Every year, we have an annual meeting to hang out, throw a party, and
elect a new board of directors based on our company
<a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.interlockroc.org/wiki/index.php/Bylaws">bylaws</a>. We are
happy to announce a lot of new faces ready to bring some ideas to the
space.</p>
<p>Our new president,&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/yorgle">Scott
Lawrence</a>&nbsp;brings his background in
electronics, software development, antique computer hardware, electronic
reverse engineering, and Legos to the position. Carl Schmidtmann will
complete a second term as Vice President providing his knowledge of
numerous subjects&nbsp;including&nbsp;super computers, Linux, electronics and all
kinds of subjects. A relatively new member, Joe Hale is welcomed in as
our Secretary. &nbsp;Bill Horst-Kotter will be representing the &quot;Member at
Large&quot; position.</p>
<p>We are especially excited about our new treasurer, <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/hoopycat">Ryan
Tucker</a>, as he has been investing time
into &nbsp;improving our financial situation, helping to make&nbsp;it easier&nbsp;to
take in donations as a newly 501c3, and making sure that money is being
spent wisely. As a member, Ryan&nbsp;will continue to leak out his knowledge
related to&nbsp;RF, software-defined radios, software development,
electronics,&nbsp;networking, and all kinds of interesting subjects we have
yet to discover.</p>
<p>We look forward to&nbsp;the next generation of Interlock Rochester's board of
directors.</p>
