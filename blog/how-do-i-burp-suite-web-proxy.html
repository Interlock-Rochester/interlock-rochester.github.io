    <p>We'll be continuing our seminar series showing the basics of various
tools for each of Interlock's interest groups. In October, we'll have
our first How Do I (HDI) related to security -- Burp Suite.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Burp Suite is an HTTP/HTTPS proxy tool that can help you better
understand how a web application works. Designed for security, it
allows anyone to man-in-the-middle(MITM) web traffic, learn how a
web application works, and manipulate the traffic to see how the
application responds. Uses include:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">- debugging your web application to find why it doesn't work</div>
<div class="line">- identifying and exploiting security vulnerabilities</div>
<div class="line">- using it to inspect mobile traffic</div>
<div class="line">- answering the question ... &quot;I wonder how that works&quot;</div>
</div>
<p>The seminar will start with a basic presentation about the Burp
Suite tools which is provided free to download.[0] The class will
walk through identifying vulnerabilities in a demo web site. All
attendees are expected to bring a laptop (Linux, OSX, or Windows) or
coordinate borrowing one before the workshop. If you have the ram to
support it, it's also recommended you run Vmware Player /
Workstation / Fusion on your system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you're interested, please RSVP on the meetup site below. As always,
the workshop is open to the public for free. Please consider dropping a
few dollars in the donation bucket.</p>
