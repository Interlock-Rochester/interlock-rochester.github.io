    <p>Beginning Tuesday, October 12th at 8:00PM, Interlock will be hosting a
weekly electronics course with instructor Carl Schmidtmann. This is a
five week class that is open to members and non-members alike, and will
provide attendees with an introduction to basic electronic components
and circuits, as well as the tools and instruments used to build and
test them.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-to-expect">
<h2>What To Expect</h2>
<p>By the end of this course you should be able to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Identify common components</li>
<li>Read a schematic</li>
<li>Build basic circuit board projects</li>
<li>Design your own circuits</li>
</ul>
<p>Labs will be assigned each week and can be completed at home or at the
space. Informal sessions will be held on Thursday nights for those
looking to get more one-on-one time.</p>
<p>The supplies needed for this course will include (but are not limited
to) a soldering iron, bread board, resistors, capacitors, and LEDs. A
limited quantity of these items are available at the space, but will
need to be returned and properly sorted when finished. Availability
will, of course, be dependent on attendance. We have also received
offers to borrow larger equipment, such as oscilloscopes, but these are
expensive and in short supply, so please be careful and share
accordingly.</p>
<p>At the end of the five weeks, we may continue with more in-depth
coverage of specific topics like motor control, sensors, or
microprocessing.</p>
<p>This course is free to all, but donations from non-members are strongly
encouraged and greatly appreciated.</p>
