  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Somewhere in my online travels, I came across a nifty idea that seemed
relatively simple to pull off. &nbsp;It's called tape painting. &nbsp;The idea is
that you apply pieces of tape to a blank canvas, in any manner you want,
then paint the canvas, again, in any manner you want. &nbsp;After you're done
painting, you remove the paint to reveal spaces of black canvas
interspersed with your painting.</p>
<p>Here's the blank canvas I started with:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2013/12/100_2677.jpg"><img alt="blank canvas" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1595" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2013/12/100_2677-300x225.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 225px;" /></a></p>
<p>I picked it up, like all my canvas's at Ollie's here in Rochester.
&nbsp;Hopefully, it goes without saying that you remove the plastic and label
that it comes wrapped in.</p>
<p>The next step is to apply the tape. &nbsp;You can do this with just about any
masking-type tape. &nbsp;I chose painters tape because that's what I had on
hand. &nbsp;You can apply the tape in any pattern you like. &nbsp;I chose a
geometric patter, making sure to wrap the tape all the way around the
edges and on to the back.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2013/12/100_2675.jpg"><img alt="100_2675" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1593" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2013/12/100_2675-300x225.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 225px;" /></a></p>
<p>Once the tape is applied, the painting can commence. &nbsp;This, of course,
is the funnest step. &nbsp;I typically only work with acrylic paint because
it's cheap, easy to work with, easy to obtain, easy to clean, and can be
applied with a variety of techniques. &nbsp;I decided to go with an abstract
theme because this was my first attempt with this kind of art, and when
it comes to abstract, there is no wrong way.</p>
<p>Essentially, I chose some colors, threw them on a palette, and then
applied them to the canvas at random. &nbsp;You paint right over the tape as
if it weren't even there.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I neglected to take a picture of this step, but I'm sure
you can use you're imagination.</p>
<p>After painting the canvas, making sure to extend the paint onto the
sides of the canvas, remove the tape while the paint is still wet.</p>
<p>Make sure when you remove the tape, since most of it will be stuck
together, that you don't allow the wet paint on the tape to touch the
wet paint of the canvas or you will end up with smearing that you did
not anticipate in planning the chaos of your abstraction.</p>
<p>Here's the finished product:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2013/12/100_2678.jpg"><img alt="100_2678" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1597" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2013/12/100_2678-300x225.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 225px;" /></a></p>
<p>If you have the ability to plan ahead, you should attach the picture
hangers before painting, but if you chronically forget that step as I
do, wait until the painting dries, then lay it on a towel or other
padded surface to avoid scratches, and attach the hardware to the back.
&nbsp;I typically use hardware that can be found in any picture hanging kit
from the dollar store or other reasonably cheap retail store.</p>
<p>As is true with almost anything, you can customize this project in any
way you want. &nbsp;More tape, less tape, defined pattern, no pattern,
abstract painting, realistic painting, whatever you want. &nbsp;The point is
to have fun and create a unique piece of art for very little cost.</p>
<p>Happy Painting!</p>
