<p>As seen in a previous post, I have a Tron Mini/Cabaret arcade machine.
&nbsp;I used to have a Tron full-sized (FS) machine, but sold it many years
ago. &nbsp;One thing that the FS had over the mini was lots of extra
lighting.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wAw8kLCJag4/UQllSEPSjjI/AAAAAAAACRk/LkvM9em4lmA/s1600/tron-borne-arcade.jpg"><img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wAw8kLCJag4/UQllSEPSjjI/AAAAAAAACRk/LkvM9em4lmA/s640/tron-borne-arcade.jpg" style="width: 356px; height: 640px;" /></a></p>
<p>It had artwork beyond the monitor lit with a regular light, it had a
blacklight above the control panel to make the traces glow, and make the
joystick glow. &nbsp;There's also a second blacklight below the control panel
to backlight the bottom portion as well. &nbsp;All of these lights are always
lit, making the machine extra awesome. &nbsp;On the mini, there is glow
artwork, but no light to illuminate them. &nbsp;Ever since the late 90s, I've
had a plan to change this, so I bought a pack of UV LEDs, but they've
sat dormant in my parts bin until now!</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3PQ37GAflKU/UQllX60VInI/AAAAAAAACRs/6bSx7ymUibk/s1600/91b64d71ed8b3555b56265edc340dccf.jpg"><img alt="image2" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3PQ37GAflKU/UQllX60VInI/AAAAAAAACRs/6bSx7ymUibk/s640/91b64d71ed8b3555b56265edc340dccf.jpg" style="width: 546px; height: 640px;" /></a></p>
<p>One thing that I'd like to bring to this, is to go an extra step, and
bring some ideas over from the &quot;Environmental Discs Of Tron&quot; (EDOT)
machine. &nbsp;On the EDOT, you walk inside of it... one of the few, if not
the only, games where you can do this. &nbsp;Around the monitor and control
panel are lights, similar to the FS Tron. However, on EDOT, they're
controlled by the game. &nbsp;They will flash and such when certain game
events happen. I can make this happen with Tron, using an interface to
the game, and a ROM hack.</p>
<p>Above all, the modifications made&nbsp;<strong>must be reversible without any
damage to the machine</strong>. &nbsp;I do not want to inflict any permanent damage
or changes to the cabinet. &nbsp;I will simply add lighting, make a ROM hack
to control the lights, and mount an additional board inside the cabinet.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-alUmFfgO7IU/UQllj55GK0I/AAAAAAAACR0/9DRz_vTT-7Y/s1600/2013-01-29+21.45.04.jpg"><img alt="image3" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-alUmFfgO7IU/UQllj55GK0I/AAAAAAAACR0/9DRz_vTT-7Y/s640/2013-01-29+21.45.04.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /></a></p>
<p>To start with, I need a secondary micro to control the lights. I'll use
one of my stepper motor controller/Arduino devices. I made the FTDI
programming and power interface seen above in about 30 minutes on the
piece of strip board at Interlock this past Tuesday. &nbsp;You can see the
resistor/capacitor pair to handle the programmer's reset, power, and
TX/RX lines, and a red power indicator LED for the heck of it.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IZXdgylhkJM/UQlmBOhEWjI/AAAAAAAACR8/tgu_9wa8Lcw/s1600/2013-01-29+23.37.25.jpg"><img alt="image4" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IZXdgylhkJM/UQlmBOhEWjI/AAAAAAAACR8/tgu_9wa8Lcw/s640/2013-01-29+23.37.25.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /></a></p>
<p>After a bit more work, I had the 3 LED driver chips wired up, with their
8 outputs, along with the 5 pin header which I'll be using to interface
it with the arcade machine. &nbsp;The pinout there is two bits of input, 5v
power input, and ground. &nbsp;I'll add in SPI-like (clock+data)
communications from the TRON game. &nbsp;I figure that the first version will
just send down a packet stating the lighting effect, but in the future I
can use this to send down high scores as well, which can be sent out via
serial to a host PC and post them on the net or something like that.</p>
<p>At first it didn't power on properly, and the LED driver chips got VERY
hot. &nbsp;Then I remembered that the circuit diagram I was referring to
while soldering this up was incorrect and had power and ground reversed
to the chip. &nbsp;I also had + and - wired backwards for the LEDs as well. I
forgot that these driver chips sink current, rather than sourcing it.
&nbsp;After a little bit of emergency soldering, all of that got worked out.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BAv4m00YYho/UQlnQYvBDNI/AAAAAAAACSE/KIVSIgF94PA/s1600/2013-01-30+00.07.36.jpg"><img alt="image5" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BAv4m00YYho/UQlnQYvBDNI/AAAAAAAACSE/KIVSIgF94PA/s640/2013-01-30+00.07.36.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /></a></p>
<p><em>I've since cleaned up the wiring a bit, adding some insulation.</em></p>
<p>I decided to wire up the LEDs such that the current limiting resistor
was wired up with the LEDs, rather than on the main board. &nbsp;I'm glad I
did this, as the resistance I picked (220 ohms) was way too high.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YhLD_7PXFZI/UQlnzncUnXI/AAAAAAAACSU/RoJJSDb4td4/s1600/2013-01-30+01.39.00.jpg"><img alt="image6" class="aligncenter" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YhLD_7PXFZI/UQlnzncUnXI/AAAAAAAACSU/RoJJSDb4td4/s640/2013-01-30+01.39.00.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /></a></p>
<p><em>Enhanced image. It sadly doesn't look quite this intense in person.</em></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oE-ZamW4Z-Y/UQloCRkoH5I/AAAAAAAACSc/pEc8tMDBtXE/s1600/2013-01-30+01.40.49.jpg"><img alt="image7" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oE-ZamW4Z-Y/UQloCRkoH5I/AAAAAAAACSc/pEc8tMDBtXE/s640/2013-01-30+01.40.49.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /></a></p>
<p><em>Experimenting with how it will look to have LEDs inside of the joystick
to illuminate it.</em></p>
<p>The output from these LEDs was much dimmer than I was hoping for. I will
be experimenting with lower-valued resistors, as well as possibly
doubling-up LEDs for lighting the various artwork elements. &nbsp;I also need
to figure out how to mount the LEDs without damaging the machine at all.</p>
<p>Next up is the ROM hack to talk with this!</p>
