    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/6356772513/"><img alt="The Workshop" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6107/6356772513_7c2a8f93cc_z.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /></a></p>
<p>It's true, we've managed to move all of our gear and junk into a new
space. We're in the same building, but we've now got over twice the
space, and some delineation between a workshop sort of room, and other
rooms that are more office-like. Above, you can see a shot of the new
workshop. It's pretty close to the size of our entire previous space,
and we're excited to fill it up with useful tools and fun projects. The
first step though, was painting:</p>
<p>In addition to having more space, we also finally got roof access. That,
plus a particularly motivated new-ish member (Walter), means that we
already have a respectable antenna farm installed up there, perfect for
the roughly 50% of our membership with ham licenses.</p>

<p>We've set aside a whole room for all the ham gear and a secondary
electronics workbench (although it's already surpassing the main bench
as far as sweet gear goes).</p>

<p>The network goons have a server closet now, so normal humans can be
isolated from the constant whine of small fans and hard drives.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bert_m_b/6356747205/"><img alt="Server Room" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6240/6356747205_a4ebf9d8f1_z.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /></a></p>
<p>There's a large room set up as a classroom or conference room, perfect
for some upcoming classes that are in the works, and nicely isolated
from other noisy activities in the space. I reckon we can accommodate a
dozen people per class, if they all need hands-on desk space, and more
if it's just rows of chairs.</p>

<p>There's more to the space that hasn't been shown here. Three more rooms
in fact... some of which we're not quite sure what to do with. If you
want to see more pictures, there's always <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/interlock_roc/pool/">our flickr

yet: come visit us in person! Check out <a class="reference external" href="/pages/calendar.html">our
