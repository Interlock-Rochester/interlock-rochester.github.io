<p>If you've ever considered donating to Interlock, but didn't like the
fact that we were only a New York State non-profit organization, well
now you can rejoice&nbsp;as our Federal 501c3 status as a non-profit
organization has been approved. Last night we celebrated our new&nbsp;Federal
status and discussed some of the potential options we have.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-this-means">
<h2>What this means</h2>
<p>While this doesn't change a lot from a day-to-day basis, it does mean
that if someone was interested in donating to the space to get a tax
write-off, we are able to give you a voucher for you to use in your
taxes. Some ideas for donations include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Cash donations to help pay our rent</li>
<li>Materials donation that go towards a specific project</li>
<li>Computer equipment donations (within the last 4 years)</li>
<li>3D printers</li>
<li>Various other gadgets that you think we could use</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll soon be stream lining our donation process&nbsp;but in the mean time,
you can email your donation questions to info at interlockroc.org.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="changes-to-dues">
<h2>Changes to Dues</h2>
<p>As we progress, we will also be making changes to the way that we
collect dues. While we cannot say that&nbsp;membership dues are a tax write
off, we can adjust our dues so that a portion is for membership, and a
portion is a donation for the write off. If this confuses you, don't
worry, we'll take care of the hard work for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="next-steps">
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>We're still in the process of updating our&nbsp;system for accepting
donations, changing how dues are accepted,&nbsp;and working on taking
advantage of our status, but in the mean time if you have any questions,
you can email info at interlockroc.org.</p>
