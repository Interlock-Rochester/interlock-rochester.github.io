    <p>This Thursday the 19th, we have another installment of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.meetup.com/Interlock-Rochester-Hackerspace/events/220284849/">Software
Defined Radio (SDR)
workshop</a>.
The goal of which is to provide introductory support to people learning
about SDR's as well as let some of the more seasoned folk work on their
projects. We've talk to a lot of people lately about what an SDR is and
why we have a workshop for it so I thought&nbsp;I'd review why they're fun.</p>
<p><strong>What is an SDR?</strong></p>
<p>Unlike some&nbsp;radio equipment which only provides a small range of
frequencies you can transmit and receive on, SDR's&nbsp;let you use&nbsp;a single
device, and control their frequency from very low (&lt;100Mhz) to very high
(2.4GHz+).</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="{filename}wp-uploads/2015/02/hdsdr11.jpg"><img alt="hdsdr1[1]" class="size-medium wp-image-1902 aligncenter" src="{filename}wp-uploads/2015/02/hdsdr11-300x169.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 169px;" /></a></p>
<p><strong>So what?</strong></p>
<p>In the past,&nbsp;if you wanted to listen in on a certain frequency, say your
garage door opener for example, you'd have to buy a piece of hardware
that runs at that frequency -- in this case it's often 434MHz. Now for
as little as $20, you can buy a device that can read your <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rtl-sdr.com/using-rtl-sdr-ti-chronos-rf-wristwatch-copy-garage-door-opener/">garage door
opener at
433Mhz</a>,
listen to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rtl-sdr.com/video-tutorial-hak5-gnu-radio-fm-radio-receiver/">local FM radio
station</a>
at 90.5Mhz, or <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rtl-sdr.com/adsb-aircraft-radar-with-rtl-sdr/">track airplanes at
1090Mhz</a>.
This lets you play with different frequencies and see what's being
transmitted. You may be surprised.</p>
<p>This also lets you learn about the basics of RF: electronics,
antennas,&nbsp;ways to decode a signal.</p>
<p>The workshop is open to the public; non-members are welcome as
always.&nbsp;Feel free to drop a comment on the meetup page if&nbsp;you're
interested but have some questions.</p>
