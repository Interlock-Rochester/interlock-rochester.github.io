        <p>One of the things that comes with working on a lot of projects is
failure. &nbsp;Not everything works. &nbsp;I've had my share of projects that for
one reason or another, just didn't work out. &nbsp;Tonight, I worked on one
of these.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XJGRCMuyj2o/UJoNvgJQuRI/AAAAAAAAB5s/NPDbRYe7WqE/s1600/2012-11-07+02.07.52.jpg"><img alt="image0" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XJGRCMuyj2o/UJoNvgJQuRI/AAAAAAAAB5s/NPDbRYe7WqE/s640/2012-11-07+02.07.52.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 475px;" /></a></p>
<p>For a long time now, I've had some ideas that center around EPROMs.
&nbsp;I've been using EPROMS since I started getting into arcade machine
collecting. &nbsp;EPROMs are programmable devices where you can store bytes
of memory in a fairly stable method. &nbsp;They look like any other
microchip, except that they have a transparent window on the top
(usually quartz, even though it looks like glass). &nbsp;If you look in the
window, you can see the chip die in there, which I usually think looks
like a tiny tennis court.</p>
<p>The above image shows a few different size. &nbsp;The one on the right is a
2716, 16 kilobit (2 kilobyte) device. &nbsp;The one in the middle is a
27C256, 256 kilobit (32 kilobyte) device.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-I98O53ShKxo/UJoNZzepHdI/AAAAAAAAB5c/aEIHuJ1Qt6A/s1600/2012-11-07+02.02.53.jpg"><img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-I98O53ShKxo/UJoNZzepHdI/AAAAAAAAB5c/aEIHuJ1Qt6A/s320/2012-11-07+02.02.53.jpg" style="width: 235px; height: 320px;" /></a>To use an EPROM, you place it in an eraser, which is usually a
ultraviolet light (often a fluorescent, non-filtered black light tube)
with a timer, for about 10-12 minutes or so. &nbsp;This sets all of the bits
in the device to 1's. &nbsp;(0xff hex).</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1kK5sgB9PnU/UJoNkK2lUHI/AAAAAAAAB5k/5D_oMNYxpl4/s1600/2012-11-07+02.04.28.jpg"><img alt="image2" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1kK5sgB9PnU/UJoNkK2lUHI/AAAAAAAAB5k/5D_oMNYxpl4/s400/2012-11-07+02.04.28.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 296px;" /></a></p>
<p>Then you take the chip, and plug it into a programmer. &nbsp;A computer tells
the programmer what zeroes to write and where, and you end up with a
chip that has a program or some data stored in it, so that it can be
read out later. &nbsp;Often, the window is then covered up so that they are
not accidentally erased over time from ambient UV light. One data sheet
I read said that 1 week in direct sunlight, or 3 years in normal office
lighting will erase a device. &nbsp;The programmer above is my Needham's
EMP-10. &nbsp;It has a 30 pin simm-looking slot on the side with 3 snap-in
cards that configure the programmer pins so that it can handle a variety
of different target device EPROMs.</p>
<p>This process has fascinated me since I started burning ROMs for use in
arcade machines. &nbsp;This is where this project comes in.&nbsp;I've had a few
thoughts about things to explore here...</p>
<p>First of all, it should be possible to determine which bytes are in
which physical locations on the device by casting a shadow or projecting
an image onto the die from the eraser. &nbsp;It should be possible to
determine this by projecting different patterns on the die with the UV
erasing light. &nbsp;Obviously, it has to be well focused; this has to be
quite precise. &nbsp;A project for another day...</p>
<p>Secondly, I thought a fun project might be to read the pattern produced
by erasing the device. &nbsp;I would program all zeroes to the EPROM. &nbsp;The
chip would be plugged into an Arduino, to read the data out of it. &nbsp;The
Arduino would also control a UV LED or two which would illuminate the
window on the EPROM, erasing it. &nbsp;It would then alternate between
illuminating the window and reading the content out of it. &nbsp;The data
pulled out would then be displayed as an image with pixels white if the
content is a '1', and black if it is a '0'. &nbsp;This should show all white
at the start, and all black at the end, with some amount of dithering in
the middle somehow.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bLHjaeRhyTs/UJoNH7rnlMI/AAAAAAAAB5I/UdksQ0NSy0U/s1600/2012-11-07+01.58.52.jpg"><img alt="image3" class="aligncenter" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bLHjaeRhyTs/UJoNH7rnlMI/AAAAAAAAB5I/UdksQ0NSy0U/s320/2012-11-07+01.58.52.jpg" style="width: 320px; height: 320px;" /></a></p>
<p>I have a bunch of chips pulled from various electronic gadgets over the
years, and the most prevalent of them was this 2732. &nbsp;It has a nice
small package, small data size (4 kilobytes), so downloading the content
from it should be fairly quick... and I have a whole lot of them, so if
a few get destroyed in the process, it's no big deal.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EHaidC5ynzI/UJqCpZJViSI/AAAAAAAAB6Q/hsr864Oeovc/s1600/2012-11-07+12.JPG"><img alt="image4" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EHaidC5ynzI/UJqCpZJViSI/AAAAAAAAB6Q/hsr864Oeovc/s400/2012-11-07+12.JPG" style="width: 400px; height: 338px;" /></a></p>
<p>At first I considered hooking this EPROM up directly to the Arduino, but
I need 24 lines to control it. &nbsp;16 for address to the chip, 8 for data
from the chip. &nbsp;Not to mention a line to drive the LED. &nbsp;I could go with
an Arduino Mega, or Due, but I do not own either. &nbsp;I only really needed
12 of those 16 address lines, which would bring it to 20 IO needed,
which is still more than was available.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--ywYLtULcPk/UJqCoRfi1xI/AAAAAAAAB6E/PmrjTU_-fxE/s1600/2012-11-07+11.JPG"><img alt="image5" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--ywYLtULcPk/UJqCoRfi1xI/AAAAAAAAB6E/PmrjTU_-fxE/s400/2012-11-07+11.JPG" style="width: 400px; height: 291px;" /></a></p>
<p>I do have a spare&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://mayhewlabs.com/products/arduino-mux-shield">Mayhew Labs Mux
Shield</a>, (mine is
a previous version) so I decided to just run with that. &nbsp;Unfortunately
this is where the story goes south. &nbsp;I went from idea to making the
board in one day. I really should have spent more time thinking about
it, and less time being impulsive and just creating the thing. &nbsp;I was
too excited, incorrectly thinking that I had what I needed for the
project.</p>
<p>I should note that I often enjoy when a project fails. &nbsp;It really helps
me learn what I did wrong, why it didn't work, and then it's like a
puzzle to figure out how to make it work. &nbsp;Sometimes, things just get
frustrating and I will shelve a project indefinitely, but often I figure
things out.</p>
<p>I wired up a socket, cobbled together from smaller DIP sockets, onto a
piece of strip board. &nbsp;I also threw a few indicator LEDs onto the board
for various runtime display. After an evening of work, I came up with
the board as seen here:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vcDaSPXWoTg/UJoM13i_plI/AAAAAAAAB44/74-H3Fn2ZvA/s1600/2012-11-06+22.50.45.jpg"><img alt="image6" class="aligncenter" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vcDaSPXWoTg/UJoM13i_plI/AAAAAAAAB44/74-H3Fn2ZvA/s400/2012-11-06+22.50.45.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 296px;" /></a></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-loed2kQYnbY/UJoNDHYXfRI/AAAAAAAAB5A/-sgcl3ynaKI/s1600/2012-11-06+22.50.58.jpg"><img alt="image7" class="aligncenter" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-loed2kQYnbY/UJoNDHYXfRI/AAAAAAAAB5A/-sgcl3ynaKI/s400/2012-11-06+22.50.58.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 296px;" /></a></p>
<p>It was wired on the circuit side of the board (I do not recommend this)
because then I could easily plug it in to the Mux Shield using the pin
connectors I had. &nbsp;The three red LEDs are wired to a few unused port
pins on the mux, and the frosted LED on the right is an amber LED which
I scuffed the top of to make it glow more than illuminate. &nbsp;I have yet
to power this up, because it was at this point, when I was done building
it that I realized the problem.</p>
<p>The Mux Shield is an excellent device. I use it for my Jasper Box to
read inputs. &nbsp;For inputs, it's awesome. &nbsp;It'll do 48 IO, even analog
input. &nbsp;For output, that's where it gets a bit&nbsp;non-intuitive.</p>
<p>The chips used on it are unbuffered. &nbsp;That is to say that there's no way
to specifically sample or store data out or in on it. &nbsp;You pick a line,
and then immediately read or write from it. &nbsp;Think of it as a valve, not
a view. &nbsp;This is to say that at any one point in time, you're only
setting or reading one bit. &nbsp;When reading the EPROM, I want to specify a
single address (16 bits of digital output) then read in the data from
the chip (8 bits of digital input). &nbsp;I can only do one bit at a time, so
it is impossible to set the 16 bits simultaneously.</p>
<p>In order for this to work, I need to add a latch of some kind to the
circuit to store the 16 bit address, so that I can then read in the 8
bits of data for that address in the EPROM.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FDgWE5um2xI/UJqCnxDW4YI/AAAAAAAAB6A/b3ycReA1ZTY/s1600/2012-11-07+10.JPG"><img alt="image8" class="aligncenter" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FDgWE5um2xI/UJqCnxDW4YI/AAAAAAAAB6A/b3ycReA1ZTY/s400/2012-11-07+10.JPG" style="width: 327px; height: 400px;" /></a></p>
<p>Here's a sketch for the next version of this project. &nbsp;As you can see,
instead of using the Mux Shield, I'm now using a pair of&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/733">74HC595
serial-in, parallel-out shift
registers</a>&nbsp;chained together.
&nbsp;The idea here is that I would shift in the address I want to read
through both of the '595s, then latch in the data on the&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9519">74HC165
parallel-in, serial-out shift
register</a>. This is actually
taking it one step too far, since the '165 is unnecessary. &nbsp;The thing on
the left is the UV LED and its resistor.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ptkXdzVAcIg/UJqOvYeUR5I/AAAAAAAAB6k/R7b3MIyQJVA/s1600/2012-11-07+11.35.20.jpg"><img alt="image9" class="aligncenter" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ptkXdzVAcIg/UJqOvYeUR5I/AAAAAAAAB6k/R7b3MIyQJVA/s400/2012-11-07+11.35.20.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 387px;" /></a></p>
<p>So here's a simplifed version where the data lines of the EPROM are
hooked directly into the Arduino. &nbsp;It also shows three indicator LEDs on
the top, which will be used to show the state of the device at runtime.</p>
<p>I need to order some parts to build this, and once I get them, I will be
posting further results on the project.</p>
