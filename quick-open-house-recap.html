    <article>
        <p>I&nbsp; don't have tons of statistics or great pictures or anything--I
suppose those that have them might post them later--but in the meantime
I figured I'd give a quick recap of my experience at our open house
Friday, before it fades too much further from active memory into the
realm of myth and legend.</p>
<p>It was, in short, a great time.&nbsp; We had a fairly good variety of folks
wander through, from pre-teens on up.&nbsp; I spent a while fishing out from
a small water-filled [STRIKEOUT:crockpot] slow cooker <a class="reference external" href="http://interlockroc.org/dashing-through-the-thermoplastic-2.html">fun little blobs
of warm
polycaprolactone</a>
These I then shoved into the hands of anyone who would take them as they
wandered through our conference/presentation/meeting room. It was great
seeing folks' reaction to its warm, pliable nature and to listen to them
comment about how tough and rigid it is once cooled.&nbsp; It's a very
minimalistic but (at least I'd like to think) very representative
demonstration of the interactive, collaborative, exploratory,&nbsp; hand's-on
environment we try to provide at Interlock to members and guests alike.</p>
<p>I took a bit of a break from running my mouth and from noodling around
in the hot water and gooey PCL&nbsp; to watch&nbsp; a short but sweet
<a class="reference external" href="http://toool.us/">TOOOL</a>-designed lockpicking slideshow, followed by
a lockpicking workshop.
<a class="reference external" href="/author/antitree.html">Antitree</a> had done the
pied-piper trick, drawing a bunch of kids-in-fact and kids-at-heart into
the conference room for a short statement of the lock picking rules, a
little bit of lock construction and mechanism theory and picking
how-to.&nbsp; Then everyone took turns with the several sets of lock picking
tools and real locksets for some hand's-on experience.&nbsp; Folks really
seemed to have a good time with trying it out.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the space, all the folks <a class="reference external" href="http://interlockroc.org/open-house-new-space.html">originally promised to
appear</a> were
around.&nbsp; I can only guess at how awesome their presentations were, but
there seemed to be people everywhere.&nbsp; Early on, I was worried no one
would make it into the not-a-kitchen for snacks, but that turned out to
be not-a-problem.</p>
<p>Not sure how much of the traffic was driven by word-of-mouth versus
posted fliers, but I know at least some folks had seen our <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rochestercitynewspaper.com/entertainment/pop-culture/2012/03/The-gee+k-guide-to-Rochester/">lead-off
part in a feature in the independent weekly tabloid Rochester City
Newspaper</a>.</p>
<p>The lead-up to the open house rekindled a fire under some of our 3D
printing aspirations.&nbsp; I don't want to give too much away there, but
that's been bubbling along these last few weeks.&nbsp; And, in addition to
folks who made it on Friday, we've also been having new folks continue
to come in for our weekly Open Night.&nbsp; This week, we met John, who
brought us some fun new-to-us toys (again, perhaps more on that later,
but in the meantime, thanks, John!).&nbsp; Also, we got to meet and talk to
(a different, distinct) Joe and Andrew.&nbsp; And so it goes.</p>
<p>If you came to visit us Friday, we hope you liked what you saw and will
come back.&nbsp; If you missed it, not to worry:&nbsp; Please keep an eye on our
calendar for other events (at least two every week).&nbsp; Or, if you can't
make it then, drop us a line and maybe we can work out an appointment
for some other time.</p>
