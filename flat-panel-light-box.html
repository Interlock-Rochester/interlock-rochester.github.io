<p>I've been getting into making stained glass pieces, as I've been taking
a class at the Rochester Memorial Art Gallery. &nbsp;One of the tools they
have available there is a light box, which I have used to make the
template for the macaw piece I'm making. &nbsp;I used it to help me adapt a
pattern I found online into something that better suits my needs. &nbsp;I
traced it, then retraced that sketch.</p>
<p>The light box also works well to see how things look with light behind
them, however it's not something I can use a lot for this, since my
project is a couple dozen pieces of glass and we have to share the light
box.</p>
<p>On the recycle pile at work was a couple of old, broken laptops. &nbsp;I
snagged two of them; one with an LED backlight, and one with a CCFT
backlight. &nbsp;I thought that the LED one would be easier to get working.</p>
<p>Over at <a class="reference external" href="http://interlockroc.org/">Interlock</a>, I tore apart the
screens, tossing out the LCD panel, so I was left with just the light
source, light guide, diffusion screens, and control circuitry. &nbsp;Its
control/driver board also managed the LCD itself. &nbsp;There were many test
points on the back, so I applied power to the &quot;LED PWR&quot; pin, ground to a
ground point, then about +5 volts to the BLEN (assuming it to be
&quot;backlight enable&quot;) as well as the &quot;PWM&quot; test point. After futzing with
it for a little bit, I gave up and focused efforts on the CCFT-based
one.</p>
<p>The slightly larger CCFT (Fluorescent) based one had a single board that
connected to the backlight tube through standard white/pink
silicone-insulated wiring. &nbsp;The board itself had one tiny connector on
one side with a few pins that seemed to have obvious use. &nbsp;V+, which
assumably powers the backlight circuitry, should be connected to +5 or
maybe +12. &nbsp;GND, which of course is ground. Then two other connections
&quot;EN&quot; and &quot;CTRL&quot;, which I guessed to be &quot;Enable&quot; and &quot;Control&quot;. &nbsp;A guess
would be to tie these to a logic &quot;high&quot; which might maybe enable the
thing.</p>
<p>I connected just the V+ and GND to a power supply, and applied power.
&nbsp;Ranging from 0v up through 12v yielded no results. I connected the
other two logic lines to power too, and started ramping up the power.
&nbsp;At around 7v, the backlight flickered on, but then wouldn't do anything
until I brought the power back to 0v, and then back up again.</p>
<p>On a hunch, I figured that the backlight needs a higher voltage, and the
logic stays at TTL levels. &nbsp;Applying the same power to both would give a
possible point between the two where both kinda worked, which is where I
saw the flicker. &nbsp;I hacked together two power supplies, with grounds
tied together, 5v from one power brick, and the V+ to the variable
supply.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9We5elFk1J8/VFpB9JnXiDI/AAAAAAAAC7w/UR087-rhETA/s1600/2014-11-04%2B22.18.15.jpg"><img alt="image1" class="aligncenter" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F1.bp.blogspot.com%2F-9We5elFk1J8%2FVFpB9JnXiDI%2FAAAAAAAAC7w%2FUR087-rhETA%2Fs1600%2F2014-11-04%252B22.18.15.jpg&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /></a></p>
<p>I ramped up the voltage, and sure enough, it would get dim around 7v,
then go full brightness around 12v. &nbsp;It seemed to use about 300mA to
drive it too. Good to know. &nbsp;I found a 12v power brick and.. it would
light for about 20 seconds then power itself off. &nbsp;The 12v brick put out
18v.</p>
<p>I eventually found a brick that worked, so i hooked up two supplies, a
5v and a 12v and it was stable and bright. &nbsp;Next would be the task to
put in a 5v regulator to provide the 5v it needs, so i can run it all on
one single power supply.</p>

<p>A simple circuit using a 7805 and two capacitors later, and I have 12v
in, and a backlight lit! &nbsp;I wrapped the circuit in tape (purple because
it was there), hooked it up to a power connector, and reassembled the
case.</p>

<p>Best of all, it all managed to fit within the old plastics. Huzzah!</p>
<p>Now I just need to put something on the diffusers to protect them from
cut glass, maybe a piece of plexi, or even a large Ziplock or plastic
wrap, and I'll be set!</p>
