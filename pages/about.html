        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>Interlock Rochester is a 501(c)3 non-profit Hackerspace whose goal is to provide a physical space and community to its members and the public at large. We provide workshops, classes, and a community of hackers with a wide range of interests: 3D Printing, information security, electronics, micro-controllers, laser cutting, radios, programming, networking, and much more that falls on the geek spectrum.</p>
<p>Interlock’s space consists of a variety of rooms for different purposes. A workshop room for metal and wood working, two electronics benches for soldering and electronics projects, a true radio shack with radio equipment, spectrum analyzer, ham radio gear as well as a presentation room with AV equipment for presentations and workshops. Interlock is run based on members support but is open to the public for all of its community events. Membership is never required to attend.</p>
<p>Interlock began in October of 2009 when a small group of like-minded technologists saw the need for a common work and play space for Rochester’s vast number of talented engineers, designers, and artists. The group was officially incorporated on December 1st, 2009.</p>
<h2>What is a hackerspace?</h2>
<p>A hackerspace is a physical location for individuals to gather, collaborate, socialize, work on projects, and make things. There are more than 350 hackerspaces worldwide that have registered with Hackerspaces.org, a lot of which have been established for several years, while some are still in the early planning stages.</p>
<p>As a part of the hackerspace community, we are involved in a growing movement to expand, rethink, and refactor technology in a collaborative, creative environment. Participating in this community allows our organization the ability to expand and connect with like minds globally, from collaborating on projects to attending and supporting virtual and physical events sponsored by other hackerspaces.</p>
<h2>Who are our members?</h2>
<p>The members of Interlock Rochester have diverse backgrounds and interests, and there are no requirements for background knowledge. You do not need to be an expert in any given area of computing, science, mathematics, or art. We take pride in welcoming anyone into our community who has a genuine interest in learning, sharing, and collaborating on ideas and projects.</p>
<h2>What kind of projects do you work on?</h2>
<p>Members have a very wide range of backgrounds including 3D Printing experts, electronics engineers, radio enthusiasts, programmers, information security boffins, network admins, classic arcade aficionados, and the list goes on. Members often bring their personal projects to space to share or ask for help on. You can see what projects we’re working on at our Trello Page. Members often work in teams to complete their projects. If you have a project you’re looking for a partner in, stop by and meet the group.</p>
